            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap> That is, of the faith of Jeſus, of the Chriſtian Faith.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>MY Deſign here is, to make the Chriſtian Religion, in theſe great parts of it <hi>Chriſts Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Mans Juſtification</hi> by it, plainly accountable, and ſo more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable unto you.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40303:3"/>
            <p>I ſhall enter into the Body of this Diſcourſe, by theſe praeliminary ſteps.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God having created man a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creature, capable of moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is, by immediate reſultan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, his King and Governour, and ſo giveth him a Law, which was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Law with a Commination, but a Covenant with a Promiſe of eternal Happineſs, upon perfect and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Obedience; and, as a Law, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Death upon every Diſobedience. <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all things written in the law to do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Man loſeth all; becometh ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the Curſe: to ſuch a Curſe as might make us ſay with <hi>Moſes,</hi> We exceedingly fear and quake, when we hear, or ſpeak, or think of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What ſhould God now do? Should he pardon? Should he let go this hold of us? Should this horrible Threat and Sanction of the Law va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh into ſmoak? We would be apt indeed through ſelf-love to ſay, Yea, by all means pardon us, and do not inflict the Penalty. But could give
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40303:3"/> no reaſon, but, Pardon us, right or wrong. But this is as if an offender ſhould ſay, The Law is juſt and equal, execute it therefore upon others, but ſpare me, it is I: as if a weak Mother ſhould ſay, when her Son is convict of Felony, Spare him, he is my Son. But theſe words are not dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but meerly of folly, ſelf-love, and intereſt. All mercy is not a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but that which will conſiſt and comport with other perfections of Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is a blemiſh, weakneſs, and fooliſh pity.</p>
            <p>I grant here; The Truth of God would be no hinderance to this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: For a Rector and Law-giver by meer threatning, by making a Law with an annexed Penalty, doth not in ſo doing part with his ſupra-legal Power, with his Power of diſpenſing with his Law, except he reveal that he will not in any caſe diſpenſe with it: For, Threatnings of themſelves do only conſtitute the dueneſs of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, and make the Offender ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious: Promiſes indeed give a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40303:4"/> right to the party to whom they are made: which the party promiſing cannot diſſolve, or take away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent; and to break them, would be falſhood and unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If a Parent threaten to beat his Child if he commit ſuch an offence, he is ordinarily bound ſo to do; it would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ickleneſs and a looſning of his Authority (which he is bound to keep up) to do otherwiſe; but he is not ſo bound, as to be guilty of untruth; if he do otherwiſe, you cannot ſay he lyed. Threatnings im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and eſſentially do only conſtitute this, That the Rector ſhall have this authority over you, which he may at his pleaſure execute; and it would be to deſtroy government ordinarily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to execute them, not to keep his laws ſacred and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: But he that threatneth, may yet pardon, without being guilty of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth; his truth doth not hinder, but other things. And we are ſure, God hath not executed this Law; elſe all offenders had utterly periſhed; for it threatned the offenders. And Truth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40303:4"/> doth as much oblige to inflict it on the offenders, as to inflict it at all. Now theſe things ordinarily hinder Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours from diſpenſing with their Laws; and ſo they would be hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances unto God here from meerly pardoning.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Should God meerly pardon; This doth not become a Governour that hath made a Law in wiſdom; to do ſo, would be to caſt an imputation on himſelf of weakneſs, either in Power or Wiſdom: In Power, as if he was weak and unable to vindicate his injured Law: In his Wiſdom, as if he thought his Law unequal, or raſhly and unadviſedly made; and as if he thought his injured Law unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a vindication. Meerly to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, would be to caſt di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t in his own face, and to proſtitute the honour of his Power, Wiſdom, and Holineſs, through fooliſh pity, as if his Law was not holy, juſt, and good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Should God meerly pardon, it would be to weaken his rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over Angels and Men. To ſuffer m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n to trample on the Majeſty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40303:5"/> of God, without a vindication of his Honour, would be to encourage of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders by impunity. That Rector is guilty of violating the authority of his own Laws, that executeth not the threatned ſeverity of the Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt offenders. And if God ſhould do thus, we might put the Apoſtle's queſtion, How ſhould God judg the world? <hi>How ſhould he then rule the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 5.</note> 
               <hi>world?</hi> Who but they would have ſaid, If God diſpenſe once ſo lightly vvith his threatnings, and vvithout a valuable ſatisfaction, why may he not do ſo again? and who will value his threats? To ask for this, That God would meerly pardon; would be to ask, That God would ceaſe to be King of the World; and he might ſay, as <hi>Solomon</hi> to <hi>Adonijah, Let him ask the kingdom alſo, as well as ask that which in honour I cannot grant.</hi> How could he maintain State, and Port, and Government in the World, if he make himſelf appear ſo facile and fickle. Thus you ſee reaſons why God ſhould not pardon and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with his Law. Meer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40303:5"/> would have been an intolerable foul blot and ſtain in the face of that his Government, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to pleaſe himſelf in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing and contemplating the glory of his Attributes.</p>
            <p>4. Should God therefore execute the Law according to the threat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all offenders to all eternity; this indeed would be juſt and righteous, and plain without difficulty; and we muſt have ſaid, Thy ways, O Lord, are equal, for ours were unequal: But then theſe inconveniences had followed:</p>
            <p n="1">1. God would have loſt the glory of this Goſpel-Juſtice, this kind of Juſtice, this wiſe and ſtupendious Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, of this Juſtice and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a Myſtery; the glory of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt and merciful, puniſhing the juſt for the unjuſt; of laying the chaſtiſement of others peace upon his innocent Son; which is a glory of Juſtice beyond that (as I ſhall make appear) which would have been in executing it upon all men to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:40303:6"/>2. He would have loſt the glory of his Mercy, the glory of that Grace and Mercy which fills the hearts of his people with love, and the mouths of Men and Angels with high praiſes of God, and lays the greateſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation on the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All Religion had utterly periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the earth, <hi>truth had fallen in the ſtreets, and righteouſneſs periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the earth;</hi> there being no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with him that he might be feared, there would have been no fear, no filial fear of God; no love to God, he not beginning in love to us while enemies; no coming to God, for he that cometh to God, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God is, and that he is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of ſuch, coming and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him; no hope and ſo no moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hope being the ſpring of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. There would have been no foundation for Religion in the World.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All mankind had utterly periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo we might have cryed, as they over <hi>Benjamin,</hi> of a Tribe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So a Tribe, a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40303:6"/> whole Tribe, a goodly Tribe of the Creation had been utterly loſt; ſuch a Tribe, ſuch a beautiful Piece of God's Creation, that ſometimes it is called <hi>all creatures,</hi> and <hi>every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark. 16. 15. Col. 1. 23</note> As if a Man was the whole Creation, being ſo conſiderable a part of it. It was not ſo with the Angels; it was only ſome of them that left their firſt eſtate, and ſo ſome of them reſerved in chains of darkneſs; but here it would have been all. Some of the Trees of that Heavenly Paradiſe were left ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but all the Trees of this our Earthly would have been for Fuel, and not one for Fruit.</p>
            <p>I mention not theſe things, as if God needed to value them, or as if he muſt be moved with them, ſo as that he could not do otherwiſe than he hath done. No, we muſt ſtill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as it were, a great conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Mercy or Pity, and his ſtrict Juſtice; his Juſtice enclining him to execute it upon the offenders; and his Mercy prevailing and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the day, to provide and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40303:7"/> accept of an Offering, a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But I bring in theſe, to ſhew, there were great reaſons to diſpenſe with the Law, if it might be done with ſafety to his other Attributes. And theſe great ends will ſo far ſupport and maintain ſuch a diſpenſation with the Law (if there can be found out a compenſation, a due reparation, to the injured Law, to do it with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and juſtice) that he cannot be accuſed of Levity, of being fickle, of diſpenſing with it lightly, upon ſlight grounds and motives; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſufficient ones, though not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ones: For though Legiſlators may diſpenſe with their Laws, yet it is a weakneſs to do it upon ſleight or no grounds.</p>

               <p>Again, If God thus fore-ordained him a Propitiation, How weak and wicked is <hi>Socinus</hi> his arguing, who argues juſt contrary, That he cannot be a Propitiation, a Satisfaction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we grant, God fore-ordained him, ſet him forth to be ſo.

All that this Argument of his proves, is this, That God, though he was (as things ſtood) neceſſarily an Enemy by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his ſtrict Juſtice; yet he was ſuch an Enemy as deſired to be ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or appeaſed.

The love of God, that ſet Wiſdom on work. to find out this of Chriſt, was not the love of one that was bound in Honour and Juſtice to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40303:11"/> be an Enemy, that is, to execute the curſe upon us, as things ſtood; but of one deſirous of finding out a way that he might with ſafety to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Juſtice be a Friend as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> Could not God have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd his righteouſneſs, and his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſin, and have kept up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of his Law; and have made that honourable in diſpenſing with it upon
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40303:15"/> a leſs conſideration? Would it not have been penalty enough, ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Chriſt only to have taken upon him our nature, though he had lived as King of kings, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Princes, Kings, and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors? Or, however, to have taken on him the form of a Servant, though he had not dyed? Or yet would it not have been enough if he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone ſome little part of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Would not ſome one or few drops of his blood have ſufficed, as thoſe ſhed in his Circumciſion? Some of the Ancients have ſpoken ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning theſe things; but Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſixth, moſt ſtrangely: for by his Decretal-Epiſtle he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined this difficulty ſo rationally in the account of Canoniſts, that it is inſerted into the body of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Law, <hi>Extrav. tit. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nigenitus,</hi> viz. thus: One drop of Chriſts blood was enough to ſave the world; and therefore the over-plus of it is laid up in the Treaſury of the Church, to be given out by the Popes, in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and Indulgences. But we are
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40303:16"/> ſure, God thought it not ſufficient. By his blood is meant death. But yet there remains a ſeeming difficulty, which I never ſaw or heard endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be anſwered, except by the Pope, as I ſaid; and therefore I ſhall be the more large in anſwering of it: and thus it lies: We are ſure that God's becoming man was more than if all the men in the world had ceaſed to be: and then on the other hand, God was not ſo prodigal of his Sons blood, as to have poured it all out, if one drop would have ſerved the turn, and anſwered the ends of Satisfaction for which it was ſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſhall anſwer it plainly in theſe few Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt's Sufferings were not proper ſolution, a payment of the ſame; but a ſatisfaction: a refuſable, though valuable conſideration. His Sufferings were not an execution of the Law or Threat, but a Satisfaction that it might not be executed. See this more fully explained after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:40303:16"/>2. Satisfaction conſiſts not in <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſibili,</hi> in a Mathematical point, that we can ſay, Juſt ſo much is juſt, and no more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Satisfactions being refuſable payments, one may require more than a valuable conſideration, without any injuſtice; yea, as much more, as wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeems meet. If ſome uſeful mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in a Commonwealth (as a man fit for a General) ſhould commit ſome crime which he is to be baniſhed for by the Laws of the Land, and ſome Noble-man ſhould intercede to the Rector, the King, and offer himſelf to be whipped through the City to ſave this mans baniſhment; here, though the whipping of a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be a greater matter intrinſical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of greater value; yet if he (to keep up Law and Juſtice) ſhould refuſe to accept of this offer, here is nothing of injuſtice; yea, ſuppoſe five Nobles ſhould then offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be uſed in like manner, there is no injuſtice if he ſhould ſay, I will not pardon him except ten Nobles will be thus treated to ſave his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40303:17"/> Here is nothing of injuſtice, becauſe it is only a Satisfaction; it is refuſable, and he may refuſe <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> though a thouſand ſhould thus offer themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thoſe are more honourable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, and do more anſwer the ends of Satisfactions, that are of greater value than the penalty it ſelf: the greater the Satisfaction is, it doth by ſo much the more ſpeak inexorable Juſtice, and ſhew how little ground offenders have for the future to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect pardon and impunity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thoſe are more honourable Satisfactions, <hi>&amp; caeteris paribus,</hi> that keep as near as may be to the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty threatned by the Law; becauſe they repreſent the penalty more lively, and call it to mind more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually. As if the Noble-man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhould be baniſhed to ſave the others baniſhment, rather than be ſcourged or pay money. The known ſtory of <hi>Zaleucus</hi> is worth relating here. This <hi>Zaleucus</hi> was King of the <hi>Locrians;</hi> and he deſigning the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and reformation of his people,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40303:17"/> makes many good Laws; amongſt which this was one, <hi>That whoſoever ſhould commit Adultery, ſhould loſe both his eyes.</hi> The Prince and Heir apparent was found guilty; the King reſolves to execute the Law on his Son; the people intercede in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, (and no doubt would ſhew him a great neceſſity of diſpenſing with the Law; it would damage the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth to have his Succeſſor blind): At laſt overcome with their importunities, he finds out this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to keep up Law and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he put out one of his own and one of his Son's eyes. Suppoſe <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi> had cut off both his own arms, or had put out out one of his Son's eyes and cut off his own right hand, it would wonderfully have declared inexorable Juſtice, and they would have had little ground to have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided him with partiality; for there was ſome neceſſity to diſpenſe with the Law, and it was done upon a dreadfully awing conſideration; and his Subjects would have had very little encouragement to tranſgreſs in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40303:18"/> hope of relaxation of his Law for the future. But yet it more kept up the repute of the Law, when he did keep ſo near the very penalty of it ſelf. Here were exacted two eyes, his own and Son's.</p>
               <p>This is Anſwer enough to this Queſtion. God, though he could for the reaſons formerly mentioned, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of change of perſons; yet he thought it not good in wiſdom to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit change of penalties; or however as little a change as was neceſſary for the main ends, that we might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and Chriſt overcome death and be compleatly a Redeemer. Death was threatned, and Death ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and without blood there ſhall be no remiſſion. Yea, Soul-death was threatned, and ſhall for ſome time be inflicted; and if man could not ſee Soul-ſuffering, yet Angels might; yea, and men might in ſome meaſure, by his crying out, by his ſweating of clods of blood, and by his telling us of it, and God at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>So that whatever intrinſecal value a little penalty inflicted on Chriſt might be of (which I have you ſee freely granted) yet God made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that a little penalty inflicted on Chriſt, would not be enough to declare his righteouſneſs, but would have ſome great and wonderful ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to awe the World, Men, and Angels; to declare his hatred of ſin, and how difficulty he obtained of himſelf to diſpenſe with his Law; and how little hope tranſgreſſors may have of impunity, that ſhall make their condition hopeleſs the ſecond time, by refuſing Chriſt and Mercy. God would have ſatisfaction to the purpoſe, plenteous redemption, a plenteous price of redemption, good meaſure, preſſed down, ſhaken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and running over. You ſee there is no inconveniency in ſaying, He hath received at the Lord Chriſt's hand double for all our ſins.

               <p>Thus you ſee this part, <hi>He ſet him forth to dye.</hi> And under this head I will ſet before you theſe ſix Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations or Modifications of his death.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He dyed a grievous painful death, that God might be juſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His whole life was indeed a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſuffering of God, a continued abaſement. It is obſerved, we read of his weeping, but never of his laughing. This I know doth not prove he never did laugh; and, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it did, it would not prove it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for us; for what was the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and faculty given for? If for uſe, we are ſure it was not to laugh at ſpiritual things. It may be he never did laugh; it is poſſible that never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be the cauſe of our joy, laughter and cheerfulneſs. He was ever and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40303:19"/> anon thinking of the bitter Cup he was to drink for our health. One of the braveſt days that ever he ſaw in the days of his ſervitude, was the Transfiguration day, when <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> appeared with him in Glory; yet then it is added, <hi>and they talked of his deceaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His whole life was a life of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. Faith in his blood doth not exclude his obedience, and other parts of his ſufferings; but all are comprehended under this moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent part, which was moſt grievous and painful to body and ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Body: What torments did that endure? What ſcourgings, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings? and the exquiſiteneſs of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily temperature and conſtitution, would augment his torture; He had not dulled and blunted his ſpirits and ſenſe by intemperance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Soul: What puniſhment of ſenſe was there on his Soul in his Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Garden; when he ſweat as it were clods of blood, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto death:</hi> and an Angel was fain

What puniſhment of loſs, when he cryed out, <hi>Why haſt thou for ſaken me? We hid as it were our faces from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ſaith the Prophet; but this was a ſmall matter in compariſon of God's hiding his face. His Diſciples forſook him, but he complains not of their forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; but, <hi>why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> If it be asked, What need of ſoul-ſuffering, ſoul-trouble, was not bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily enough? It is anſwered already, God would have ſufferings as near the ſame threatned as could be; would diſpenſe as little with the Law as might be. How are the <hi>Socinians</hi> here upon the rack, when to give an account of his crying out and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure beyond the ordinary rate of Martyrs, for they ſhouted and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed; ſince they maintain he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered no otherwiſe, and on no other account than they did, only to atteſt the truth, and leave us an example of patience. They make his groaning
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40303:20"/> heavier than his ſtrokes, if he had no more of bitterneſs in his Cup than they.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſhameful death.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40303:23"/> the moſt Satisfactions we read of in humane Authors, and maketh them ingrateful unto us, is this, That either they did not undergo their ſufferings for another willingly, as when they chaſtned the Infant-Prince's darling-Pages for his fault; or if they did undergo them willingly, they had not lawful authority and power to do ſo. For men have not that full power and authority over their lives and members, to give them a compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for others, which they have over their money and eſtates. God hath not given them this power; and alſo Governours are under the Law of God, and ſo have not regularly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to take away mens lives or members upon ſuch commutations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of others; therefore thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that thought men had full au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over their lives and members, do hugely commend the act of <hi>Zaleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> in putting out one of his own eyes; and were it not for this obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, we ſhould commend it as one of the braveſt acts of Juſtice mixed with prudence, in thoſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40303:24"/> that ever was. Now both theſe difficulties are removed here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt had power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over his own life: <hi>I have power,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>my life, and authority to take it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> He had authority over his own life (as other men have not) being God. And further, we are ſure the Father gave him leave.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He willingly undertook this task of dying a Propitiation for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. <hi>Burnt-offering thou wouldſt not; then ſaid I, Lo I come, I delight to do thy will, O God. I lay down my life for my ſheep, no man taketh it from me</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">John 10. 16</note> my conſent), <hi>I lay it down of my ſelf.</hi> It was a voluntary Sacrifice, a Free-will-Offering: He was the Prieſt himſelf, offered himſelf by the eternal Spirit, though the Jews were the Butchers. <hi>Thinkeſt thou not</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Peter</hi> ſmiting off of <hi>Malchus</hi>'s ear) <hi>that I cannot now pray my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he ſhall ſend me more than twelve legions of Angels?</hi> He gave <hi>Pilate</hi> no anſwer, as if afraid of hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his own Sufferings. Had he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40303:24"/> ſpoken as he could have done, as one having authority, he could with few words have daunted <hi>Pilate</hi>'s heart, and cauſed his own releaſe. But, <hi>he went as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, as a ſheep before the ſhearer he was dumb, and opened not his mouth.</hi> So that <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> is impatient at his patience, angry at his ſilence: <hi>Anſwereſt thou not? When he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatned not.</hi> Had <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23.</note> he but threatned, he might have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his own diſmiſſion.</p>
               <p>Two things can only be objected here againſt his willingneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His great natural averſeneſs: <hi>Father, if it be poſſible,</hi> &amp;c. He fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Cup.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In ſpeaking of his Humane Nature (there is no difficulty about his Divine) we muſt diſtinguiſh with the School-men, thus: There is <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt as ut natura,</hi> and <hi>voluntas ut ratio.</hi> There is the <hi>natural</hi> will or <hi>inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the <hi>rational</hi> will: according to this natural will he deſired to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape this death, Nature abhorring things deſtructive to its ſelf: But by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40303:25"/> his <hi>rational</hi> will, for God's honour, and our redemption, he willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it. <hi>Aquinas</hi> inſtanceth thus: A Man according to his natural will deſires to avoid a bitter potion, and the lancing or cutting off of any Member; and yet by his rational will, he conſenteth to theſe for the good of the whole. And this is moſt properly to be called the will. <hi>Quod quiſque mavult<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> id maxime proprie vult.</hi> This natural willingneſs and averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in him doth commend and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the meritoriouſneſs of Chriſt's willingneſs as Mediator and merciful High Prieſt; and not at all proves his unwillingneſs, in the propereſt ſenſe of the word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here may alſo be objected: He was for the moſt part careful to ſecure himſelf from the <hi>Jews</hi> treacheries and injuries, and ſometimes fled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This doth not prove his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to ſuffer, at all; but only his chuſing the fitteſt time and hour, and his reſerving himſelf for the time and place appointed by the Father: And he uſed to ſay before, that his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40303:25"/> 
                  <hi>hour was not yet come.</hi> But conſider how he carried himſelf when his hour was come, and he knew it was come. <hi>Now before the feaſt of the Paſſeover,</hi>

They went backward and fell to the ground.</hi> He that threw them to the ground, could have thrown them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell; but he ſuffers them to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, offers himſelf, and ſaith, <hi>Whom ſeek you?

                     </gap>zareth: Jeſus anſwered, I have told you, that I am he. If therefore you ſeek me, let theſe (Diſciples) go away.</hi> He had care of them, to keep them out of cruel hands, while he willingly yielded up himſelf.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40303:26"/> He was ſtraitned, till it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
               <p>Now the main of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections fly before this, as dry leaves before the wind.</p>
               <p>One may thus rhetorize in object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them. What? ſhall not the juſt Judg of all the Earth do right? Will he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y the righteous with the wicked? However, will he ſlay the righteous, and let the wicked eſcape? Or, which is worſe, Will he ſlay the righteous for the wicked, by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the juſt for the unjuſt? Now that he underwent it willingly, anſwers all this. God hath made a Law that the Son ſhall not be put to death for the Father, much leſs one Stranger for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Therefore this maketh it ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſinful among men, to give ſuch, or for the Magiſtrate to accept ſuch commutations, becauſe God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived them of this power. But ſhall we ſay, His ways are unequal, becauſe not like or above our ways; or that that is neceſſarily unlawful to God, which he hath made ſo to us? Say they, this would declare Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40303:26"/> to ſet forth an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Propitiation for the Nocent. It would do ſo indeed, to puniſh the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent for the Nocent, except he chuſe it. All ſee it is not injuſtice to demand debts of a bonds-man, a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for God hath given men power over their eſtates; and he willingly undertook it. I grant, it is ordinarily unlawful to offer to be, or to except ſureties, and undertakers for others with lives or members; but the reaſon is, becauſe God hath not given men this power; otherwiſe it would be all one. Therefore there is no inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in his life going for ours. He had right and authority ſo to diſpoſe of his life, as we have not, and he willingly undertook it. If God was wroth with his beloved Son, it was from his own Choice and underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, through his love to us. <hi>Father, lay not the puniſhment on theſe my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and thine, I will bear it; If thou wilt be paid it have Satisfaction; pour out thy wrath on me that can ſatisfie, not on them that cannot, but by their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and utter ſinking under it.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:40303:27"/>
               <p>6. <hi>A Death of infinite Value.</hi> If Gods juſtice do require a Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it will not be put off with a meer ſhew or colour of one; or with a partial, lame, defective one; but it muſt be commenſurate and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the infinitely hainous and numberleſs ſins and provocations of Men, and to the juſtice of God; and ſo it muſt be of infinite dignity and value. Now the death of Chriſt was of infinite value; Infinite in ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but not in duration; for if in duration, then the expiation would never have been made and perfected, and ſo we ſhould never have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed. He ſhould then (and ſo we) have ever remained under the power of death and condemnation: for, the utmoſt farthing would never have been paid. It would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Chriſt; it would have been unprofitable for us, and it was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ſatisfaction, for Chriſt to have undergone pains infinite in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, But his ſufferings being actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally infinite in merit, do more than equal a ſuffering only infinite in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40303:27"/> for that would never have been actually infinite.</p>
               <p>Sins againſt God naturally deſerve (and therefore God threatens) infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite puniſhment; for Sins are increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed according to the greatneſs of the perſon againſt whom the offence is committed. <hi>They have not only rejected thee, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t rejected me,</hi> ſaith God, as a greater matter; and it is brought in as a great aggravation to ſpeak evil of Dignities; and in our Law a <hi>Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum magnatum,</hi> is a greater matter than the ſcandalizing of our Equals: Therefore Sin is of infinite demerit, being againſt an infinite God. And hence it follows, that the puniſhment of Sin, muſt either be infinite in the extremity and greatneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Now to ſpeak naturally: Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Juſtice, conſidering the ends of puniſhment in Moral Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would immediately urge, Let it, if it can, be infinite in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, weight and gravity, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender (having ſatisfied in ſuffering) might work again. But human nature being finite, is not capable of ſuch
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40303:28"/> infinite puniſhment; and upon this account it was neceſſary that it ſhould be infinite in the extenſiveneſs and duration, becauſe a finite Creature is not capable of puniſhment infinite in intenſiveneſs and greatneſs. But now when Chriſt ſuffered for us, he underwent puniſhment infinite in magnitude and greatneſs. But ſtill this infinity is to be eſtimated not from the intenſiveneſs and greatneſs of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments themſelves, which human Nature (and ſo Chriſt's human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) was not capable of; but from the dignity of the perſon that ſuffered them. Juſt as ſin that is finite in its own nature, coming from a finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becomes infinite by being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt an infinite Majeſty: So the puniſhments of Chriſt, (being in their own nature finite) became infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in their value and ſatisfaction, by the infinite dignity of the perſon ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. And the ſtreſs (as I have told you before) is ſtill laid on this, in Scripture; the dignity of the perſon, that he was God that ſuffered. And this very conſideration of his death
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40303:28"/> being infinite in value and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and not in duration, doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch a difficulty as could not be anſwered. For, had our Redeemer been to continue for ever, under this condemnation of thoſe he ſuffered for, this might have made the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion leſs rational and credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it would have been ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable exceſs of charity, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy himſelf eternally to ſave others, But God knew, and Chriſt knew, he could ſo wreſtle with death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation as to overcome, and that it would not be an utter loſing one worth ten thouſand of the guilty in ſaving them; which would have been a thing unaccountable, to be either done, or permitted to be done, by the King and Governour of the World: but his Sufferings were to be to him an entrance into Glory, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Name above every Nature.</p>
               <p>Thus of this Third Head <hi>to die</hi> and manner of this Death.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>A Propitiation.</hi> Died a Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,

Now this Mercy-ſeat, this <hi>Operculum Propitiatorium,</hi> was a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of pure Gold laid over the Ark of the Covenant, juſt the dimenſions of the Ark, the length and breadth of it.

                  </gap> ſee. We read nothing of the thickneſs of this Propitiatory Cover; but ſome <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bbins</hi> ſay it was of one Palm. And this Ark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, <note place="margin">ver. 16.</note> had in it the Law; and ſo this Mercy-ſeat or Propitiatory that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40303:29"/> covered the Ark wherein was the Law, typified and ſignified, Jeſus Chriſt fully covering our ſins (being tranſgreſſions of the Law) out of Gods ſight; the Righteouſneſs and Satisfaction of Chriſt being as broad, and as long, as the Law and our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of it. Above the Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat, on either ſide, were the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims, and the Majeſty of God appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red between the Ceerubims: Chriſt interpoſeth between God and his Law, to make him propitious to his People. <hi>From above the Mercy-ſeat</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>between the two Cherubims will I meet thee and commune with thee.</hi> So you ſee, this Mercy-ſeat, this Cover of Gold typified Chriſt, the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory, or Mercy-ſeat, covering out of God's ſight all our Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Law, and God through him meeting with us, and made propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and reconciled to us. And here now, Chriſt is called by the name of his own type, as often elſewhere, when he is called the Lamb <hi>and Lamb ſlain;</hi> and ſo called the Propitiatory, or Propitiation, God having made
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40303:30"/> him really that to us, which that did but typifie.</p>
               <p>Chriſt was made an Expiation and Ranſom, and Propitiation for Sins; for theſe things the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word ſignifies.</p>
               <p>Here now, under this Head, I will make it my buſineſs irrefragably to prove to you, what I have taken hitherto almoſt for granted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He died not for Himſelf; He was the Lamb without ſpot; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he that was to waſh away o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpots, was to be without ſpot Himſelf. <hi>Meſſiah cut off, but not for himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He could not die but for ſome Sin; Death befalleth not Men, as Men, but as Sinners. The Apoſtle proveth <hi>all to be Sinners, becauſe all die?</hi> elſe it was impoſſible in juſtice. <hi>God</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Act. 2. 24</note> 
                  <hi>raiſed him up,</hi> having looſed the pains of death; for it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he ſhould be holden of it; Death being but the Servant of God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Chriſt having ſatisfied Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, it could not but let go its hold. He could not but <hi>be taken from priſon
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40303:30"/> and from judgment.</hi> We may uſe the ſame argument: it was impoſſible, Death could not have taken hold of Him at all, had it not been for Sin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It remains therefore that <hi>he died for our ſins,</hi> according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; for none elſe come in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. None will pretend He died for the Sins of Angels, good or bad, or of Brutes which are not capable of ſin. Was delivered to death for our ſins. <hi>Bore the ſins of many. Gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us.</hi> The profeſſed Adverſaries of this Doctrine (the <hi>Socinians)</hi> will grant, He died in ſome ſenſe for our Sins. <hi>Therefore, How died he for our Sins?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He died for our Sins ſo as to turn us from them, this is truth; but this is, as they ſuppoſe, all, and they will grant no more: But we muſt go further.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He died for our Sins, as a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious deſerving cauſe of his Death. <hi>For the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſmitten. Wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.</hi>

                  <hi>Delivered to death for our ſins.</hi> So that if it be asked, What
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40303:31"/> meaneth the heat of this great anger? wherefore was he thus wounded?

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He died for our ſins; in our place and ſtead, that we might not periſh for them. In our place and ſtead for expiation, for ſatisfaction, for compenſation; though not in ſuch an un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This is plainly proved by the peculiarity of his Death. We will readily grant, He died for us, as none in the world elſe ever died for us; therefore not only for our good. <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Followers tell us, that Chriſt having taught as a Prophet ſent from God, a Doctrine of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and piety, and that they that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, believe, repent, return, ſhall be ſaved notwithſtanding all their former ſins; He died only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth of his Doctrine, and to leave the world an example of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſubmiſſion, courage in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but not for expiation, &amp; ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Certainly, Chriſt did ſome ſingular thing by his Death; and if this be all, we may ask, What ſingular thing hath he done? Have not all Martyrs done the ſame by their Death? they taught true Doctrine, and died to give Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Truth, and to encourage us in ſufferings. Did not the Apoſtles do the ſame? the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of his ſufferings for their good, in <note place="margin">Col. 1. 24.</note> this ſenſe, <hi>Who now rejoyce in my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for you, for the Church. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     </gap>1. 13.</note> for you in the ſenſe that Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for you, as a Satisfaction? as an Expiation? And if this be all the meaning of our Redemption by his blood, and Juſtification by his blood; then we may as well ſay, We are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed and juſtified by the blood of Martyrs; however as really, though not fully; his death and ſufferings being at moſt but a greater atteſtation of the truth, and encouragement of us in our ſuffering for it.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt died only for the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Goſpel which he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and for our encouragement and imitation in ſuffering for the truth; we may ſay, <hi>Where is the Lamb for the Burnt-offering?</hi> We are guilty, and want atonement; Captives, and want a ranſom. If we ſhould look on Chriſt's Death (as one ſaith) through <hi>Socinus</hi> his Spectacles, we ſhould look on it as neither ſatisfactory to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40303:34"/> God nor us; we have yet no help meet for us, there is no days-man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; he that was to come, is not come; And yet, we look not for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſhall prove it from the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices under the Old Teſtament, which typified and ſhadowed out theſe things. <hi>The Law had a ſhadow of good</hi>

                  <hi>things to come; not the very image;</hi> implying Chriſt's Sacrifice was the very reality. The blood of Bulls and Goats could not expiate moral guilt; but only ſhadowed out that which could do it. <hi>Every Prieſt ſtandeth dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Theſe Sacrifices did take away, did expiate typical guilt (in ſome ſenſe,) took away the typical puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of being excluded the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and ſociety, and ſuch tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhment as was to be inflicted
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40303:35"/> by God or Man, for ſuch faults as they were appointed Offerings for: For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The blood of bulls and goats did ſanctifie</hi> thus far, <hi>to the purifying of the fleſh:</hi> Now by <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,</hi> he meaneth expiate, (which will appear by peruſing how this Author uſeth this word in other places of that Epiſtle) and not taking away the fault it ſelf. But theſe Sacrifices were <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14 Lev. 10. 14</note> but only typical of that, which took away the eternal puniſhment and moral guilt and obligation. Now ſince theſe typical Sacri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ices were expiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſatisfactory in reſpect of typical guilt, What ſimilitude can there be? what relation of Types can they have, if Chriſt's offering up Himſelf was no expiation for real moral guilt? for Types were not ordained for their own ſakes, but for the ſake of thoſe things they did ſhadow out. Why would God put them upon ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical propitiatory Sacrifices, if they did ſignifie nothing of real Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Sacrifices were offered in Men's ſtead, in the Sinners ſtead, to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40303:35"/> make atonement for his Soul, for his Life, that he died not for ſuch typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal guilt, <hi>He ſhall put his hand on the</hi>

When a man was to die they died for him, and he was kept alive. And that which yet maketh it more plain is this, becauſe in capital offences, where men were abſolutely to die without remedy, there were (as is well obſerved by many) no private Sacrifices inſtituted, becauſe the man himſelf was to die for his fault, and ſo a beaſt could not die in his ſtead. And if Sacrifices were only offered for the good of Men, and not by way of compenſation, and expiation, in their ſtead, What poſſible reaſon can be given, why no Sacrifices were to be offered for them that were to be taken away out of the land of the living?</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40303:36"/> and propitiate himſelf, that he might not impute their ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Did not <hi>Zaleucus</hi> in part help to ſatisfie his own Law by his own ſuffering, loſing one of his own eyes (as we heard in the ſtory fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned)?

               <p>2. It is not oriouſly poſſible. God's forbidding Men to puniſh one for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, argueth the thing poſſible; he would not forbid impoſſible things. The Heathens knew it very
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40303:37"/> poſſible, we may ſee, by their offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the fruit of their body, for the ſin of their ſoul.</p>
               <p>3. It is ſo highly poſſible, that it hath been and is common amongſt Men. How common is the tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of puniſhment from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as in Hoſtages, and men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to bring out the offender? liable to the mulct of the offender. <hi>Solomon</hi> writeth much about avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuretiſhip, becauſe, the debter failing, he muſt pay.

                  </gap>, is, <hi>to declare plainly his Righteouſneſs.</hi> There is ſuch a rectitude in God's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as cauſeth him to hate ſin, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth him to puniſh it; and this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural juſtice inclineth him to puniſh fin in the perſon that commits it; but yet not as fire burneth, that cannot do otherwiſe; but this inclination (or this which we muſt conceive as analogical to an inclination) is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his wiſdom, and orderable by it. And this <hi>Oeconomy</hi> or diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning a Satisfaction, was as Governour and Rector of the world, that he might not diſhonour Himſelf in pardoning, to ſecure the glory of his Juſtice, which would otherwiſe have been aſperſed by ſins impunity, and to pleaſe himſelf in diſplaying the glory of his Attributes. God is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40303:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> juſt, and this was an act of juſtice, governing juſtice, <hi>to declare at this time,</hi> &amp;c. We are prone to think, that this time of the Goſpel was only a time of love, grace, and compaſſion to ſinners; but we ſee it was alſo a time of Demonſtration of Juſtice, of the ſtricteſt juſtice, and moſt inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble holineſs and hatred of ſin. He hereby ſheweth how little he reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth perſons, that if the deareſt Son of his love will intercede, undertake for the pardon of ſinners, He ſhall pay dear for it. Here is inexorable Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice indeed. There were indeed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer demonſtrations of God's juſtice, in the Deſtruction of the Old World; Overthrow of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity; but never any like this at this time, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his injured Law and Honour before Men and Angels.

How unworthy is it of a Rector, by impunity and indulgence, to ſeem to have a confederacy with the breakers of his Law? Though he pardon offenders, yet it muſt be in ſuch a way as there may be no ground of ſuſpition, as if he was pleaſed with ſin, become ſuch a one as themſelves, or not highly diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the violators of his Law; it muſt be upon dreadfully-awing honourable terms. What can you imagin Chriſt's Death was a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for, or a ſatisfaction unto; but to thoſe high and glorious Attributes of his Wiſdom, Juſtice and Holineſs? that ſaving the honour of theſe, he might pardon and advance to dignity rebells againſt Heaven, upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to their ſubjection and allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; that the honour and credit of theſe might be maintained, and yet the offenders not periſh. And this atroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous death of the Son of God for ſin, did do God great honour in the face of the Sun, and of the World: did aſſert his holineſs and ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

I ſhall add no more here, becauſe I have prevented my ſelf in ſpeaking largely of this before.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>That God might be juſt, and a juſtifier of faln man,</hi> that God might be juſt and merciful.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God might be juſt: it would not be ſenſe to ſtop here; for, God would have been juſt without this Propitiation, inflicting the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on ſinners themſelves; but then he would have been meerly juſt, and no juſtifier of faln man; becauſe man
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40303:40"/> could never have ſatisfied; he would have been always paying, and yet the debt always to pay ſtill; ſo that there could never have been any Juſtification of ſinners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But that he might be juſt, and a juſtifier, He ſet out Chriſt a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the remiſſion of ſins. Here you ſee two cauſes of Chriſt's death. The love of God to Man one, and the juſtice of God the other. He was induced to this amazing act by his Philanthropy, his love of man, and zeal of juſtice. <hi>He ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believed on him, might not periſh, but might have everlaſting life.</hi> And here his juſtice did not ſwallow up his Mercy, nor his Mercy his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but they are of quite diſtinct conſiderations. Here is a loud Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his Love to us, and love to his Law and Juſtice; of love to us, that Chriſt ſhould die rather than we periſh; and of love to his Law and Juſtice, in that he hereby took or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they ſhould not be injured by his pardoning of us.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:40303:40"/>
               <p>Yet obſerve well here, (for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the things, I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and ſhall ſpeak of, depend much upon it) that this love was not the love of Complacency or Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral love; for that is, and was, the fruit of Chriſt's Death; but a love of pity, ſuch as was conſiſtent with Rectoral and Legal hatred. <hi>Zaleucus</hi> might lawfully have a love of pity to his Son, before his invented Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but Rectoral wrath and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: He was bound in honour as a iuſt Rector to execute the Law, to keep it ſacred and unblemiſhed; and this reſtrained his natural pity, from doing an injury to juſtice. And this Love that I am ſpeaking of, was the Love of one that was bound in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and juſtice to be an enemy, as things ſtood; but yet of one willing to find out ſome way, that he might, with ſafety to his honour and juſtice, be a friend, as Governour; that is, might juſtly not inflict the penalty. Thus you ſee the love of Pity that ſent Chriſt, was not the fruit of Chriſts Death: But his love of Complacency,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40303:41"/> his juſtifying love, Pardoning love, Rectoral love, that is the fruit of his Death.</p>
               <p>7. Juſtifier of Sinners, of faln Man, that is implied in the word Propitiation and remiſſion of ſin, and in the whole texture of the words. And here I will ſhew you, he died for Juſtification of the greateſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, upon their acceptance of him; yea, and of ſinners then long ſince dead.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Pardon and Juſtification of the greateſt Sinners, worſt of Men, whoſe throat was an open Sepulcher, and their feet ſwift to ſhed blood; as is expreſſed before, in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The greateſt Sins cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the price paid; for they are but the Sins of Man: but the Sufferings were the Sufferings of God. They that were guilty of the hainouſeſt act that ever the Sun ſaw, of that horrid act of Crucifying Chriſt; upon their repentance, and being pricked in their hearts, were forgiven; as we read in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Pardon and Juſtification
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40303:41"/> of Sinners, then dead before Chriſt's death, God now declareth his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in the remiſſion of thoſe paſt ſins. Whether all thoſe that were juſtified and ſaved under the Old Teſtament, did know of this <hi>to come</hi> ſatisfaction, or not, I do not now diſpute. But this is plain (whether they knew of it or not) they were not juſtified and ſaved without God's having reſpect to this <hi>to come</hi> Propitiation; it was by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this which is now declared. It is now declared to Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that it was upon the account of the Satisfaction intended and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. They were juſtified by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Satisfaction deſigned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by Chriſt, and in due time to be exacted and paid; but through the forbearance of God, the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the price for ſins paſt and fore-committed, was deferred till the time of the Goſpel. A Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe is a Moral cauſe; and for a Moral cauſe to operate and have its effect, it is not neceſſary that it do exiſt, it ſufficeth that it
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40303:42"/> have an <hi>Eſſe cognitum,</hi> a beeing in knowledg. A man may be properly ſaid to have bought that which he hath not yet paid for, and may have the actual benefit of his purchaſe; if he hath undertaken the payment, and the other accepts of, and reſts ſatisfied with his promiſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. <hi>Grotius lib. de Satisf.</hi> thus interpreteth this place, <hi>remiſſion of ſins paſt.</hi> And it ſeemeth probable enough to be the meaning of this difficult place, <hi>Sanguis Chriſti profuit, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam fuit.</hi> Both the Ancients were, and we are ſaved by Chriſt; and God hath now ſet him forth a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for thoſe paſt ſins. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed till Chriſt thus came, the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was not paid, but through the forbearance of God, thus ſerved the turn, that it was undertaken, and promiſed, and typified, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Sacrifices and Types which ſhadowed it out; but the Truth, Reality, and true Sacrifice, came not till Chriſt. And God did forbear to inflict wrath on them, becauſe he ſhould at length have
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40303:42"/> ſatisfaction; and now he declareth his Righteouſneſs in exacting the prefigured Satisfaction. <hi>They drank of the ſpiritual Rock that followed them, which Rock was Chriſt.</hi> Hence it is not improbably concluded by ſome, that he is called, <hi>The Lamb ſlain from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world.</hi>

               <p>God ſet not forth Chriſt to dye meerly for this end, that Sinners might be juſtified without any more ado, only be ſinners.

The immediate effect of this Satisfaction, as ſatisfaction, and which is an eſſential conſequent of a ſatisfaction to Juſtice, is only this, That, that obſtacle being removed, he might be left at liberty to act in the pardon of ſinners, in what way, and upon what terms he pleaſed. The immediate effect is, That God might be juſt, though he ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſinners; that he might pardon <hi>ſalvá juſtitiá;</hi> not that he muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, come what will of it; or be unjuſt: not that ſinners ſhould <hi>ipſo facto</hi> be pardoned, the price be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undertaken or paid, and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Juſtice of God, as a flaming

Get theſe things well into your minds, and you may ſee through theſe miſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Labour to underſtand this, that the caſe here is not properly the caſe of Debtors, but of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subjects; and God is not to be looked upon properly as a Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but as a Rector, Governour, Legiſlator; and the Perſon Chriſt ſuſtained; and the part he acted in his Sufferings, was not in a ſtrict ſenſe (though figuratively once ſo called) that of a Surety paying the debt it ſelf, and diſcharging the Bond, by paying the very thing it
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40303:45"/> ſelf in the obligation; but of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, expiating Guilt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king reparation to Juſtice ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way than by the execution of the Law; yea, endeavouring that the Law, the legal threat, might not be executed, by making amends for the non-execution of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Get this into your minds, That the Sufferings of Chriſt were not properly an execution of the Law (though they may figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively be ſo called) but a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Juſtice, that the Law-threat might not be executed. The ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt were not the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual things threatned; for it threatned the offenders ſhould dye, and be damned; <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In the day thou eateſt, thou ſhalt dye.</hi> So that it was not Chriſt was threatned, but we; for he was not the offender. His ſufferings therefore were not the <hi>idem,</hi> but the <hi>tantundem;</hi> not proper payment, but a valuable conſideration, or you may call it a refuſable payment, though it be not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40303:46"/> properly payment at all; not ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or payment in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, but a ſatisfaction in the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſe: The eſſence of which lies in this, that it is juſtly and fairly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſable. In payment of debts, the moſt Laws admit payment by a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, and take it as all one in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Law, whoſoever pays it, ſo it be but paid; yea, in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, though it be by another without the Debtor's knowledg; it was paid by the ſame perſon in Law, though not by the ſame natural perſon; and if any Laws do lay any ſtreſs on the perſon of the Debtor, ſo that it ſhall be judged as no payment except paid in perſon, ſuch are hard Laws, and againſt natural equity; ſo that though payment ſhould juſtly according to ſuch Munucipal Laws, be refuſable from another, yet it is not fairly tefuſable: But it is quite otherwiſe in all Law and natural E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in the caſe of obedience and puniſhment: for here the Laws do juſtly and equitably determine the very perſon that ſhall obey or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40303:46"/> and allow not any delegation, as doing or ſuffering by another: ſo that if another ſuffer, it is not the ſame in Law; if the penalty be ſuffered by another natural perſon, it is ſuffered by another perſon in Law. And here, <hi>Dum alius ſolvit, aliud ſolvitur,</hi> therefore ſuch ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of another contrary to Law, may be a ſatisfaction that the Rector may with hono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r not execute the Law, but cannot poſſibly be an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Law, the <hi>idem,</hi> the ſame threatned.</p>
               <p>I will make all plain to you thus:</p>
               <p>Suppoſe the Law-threat had run thus: If any man ſin, he ſhall dye, be damned, or another for him; [he, or another] thus disjunctively; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe would have been the very thing threatned, the ſame in Law, as the Principal and Surety are; and then all theſe after-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned inconveniences would have followed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In this caſe, had God provided one to dye for us, here would have been nothing of pardon. Here indeed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40303:47"/> would have been grace and favour in thus procuring one; but nothing of pardon, remiſſion of ſin: for it would not have been a refuſable payment; either of their deaths would have been the ſame in Law, and ſo no act of Pardon or Grace to acquit upon it: whereas God for Chriſt's ſake forgiveth. <hi>We have by</hi>

                  <hi>his blood the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> This would have been like proper ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then the ſtricteſt Juſtice cannot deny an acquittance and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification to the party, for whom it is paid; and there need not be, there cannot be, in this caſe, any ſuch thing as pardon: pardon and full ſatisfaction may ſtand together, but not pardon and ſolution, or pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>e. g.</hi> If a Law be made, that threatens, That for ſuch an offence the Delinquent ſhall ſit in the Stocks, or another for him, thus disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively; here would be grace and favour in the Prince, to procure one to ſit for the offender, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of pardon or remiſſion: for the utmoſt rigour of Juſtice could
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40303:47"/> not refuſe to acquit upon it; here is no remitting any thing the Law requires, no pardon at all: for the Law never required the offender himſelf ſhould ſuffer, but he or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indifferently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It would alſo in this caſe be injuſtice to inflict the leaſt part of the penalty threatned, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the offender, when the other hath ſuffered; becauſe it would be to inflict what was never threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Law, and ſo what is not due: for the utmoſt Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no more than the ſuffering of one of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It would alſo in this caſe be non-ſenſe, or injuſtice, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Delinquent terms or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions on which he ſhould have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; the benefit of the other's death, or of the other's ſitting in the Stocks; or elſe to have no benefit by them: for the offender would have right without performing ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. And therefore as a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the offender the thing he hath right to, would be injuſtice; ſo, to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40303:48"/> reduce back his abſolute right to a conditional, would be injuſtice in part: To threaten damnation if men believe not, repent not, would be ſomething of injuſtice, being a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial denial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Alſo in this caſe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender would be juſtified immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by the other's death, by the Law that threatned, by the very Law of Works; there would need no Covenant of Grace, or Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe; it would be injuſtice to preſcribe terms of benefit by it, as Faith, Repentance, as in the other caſe the Delinquent would have right to impunity for his offence, by the other's ſitting in the Stocks, by the very Law that threatned it. There needs no Law of Grace for requital; for it is the <hi>idem</hi> in Law, the very thing threatned, and ſo not refuſable by the ſtricteſt Juſtice; to promiſe here, would be to promiſe that which we have right to without promiſe; and ſuch promiſes would not be of Grace, but meer Nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:40303:48"/>
               <p>But this death of Chriſt was a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction much like a refuſable pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for the threat was, <hi>The ſoul that ſinned ſhould dye,</hi> be damned; not <hi>he,</hi> or <hi>another.</hi> The death of Chriſt was a ſatisfaction, a refuſable pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for God might have refuſed, if Chriſt had interceded, as <hi>Moſes, Blot me, I pray thee, out of the Book of Life for the people; and ſave their ſouls, their lives.</hi> God might have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Thoſe that ſin againſt me, I have only threatned, and thoſe only I will puniſh; but of thee will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire nothing, and from thee will I accept nothing. For the threat was not, If a man ſinned he ſhould dye, or ſome other for him (for then, either of them would have been the <hi>idem,</hi> the ſame in Law), and ſo not refuſable; but it was that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf ſhould dye: ſo that whatſoever elſe than the offender's ſufferings, could be offered, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſable, and ſo could be but a Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And then theſe things will ſuit and agree:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here is pardon and remiſſion,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40303:49"/> in accepting and acquitting: for he might have refuſed to accept of Chriſt's death, and to acquit us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. It is plainly, a not ſtanding to his threat, a diſpenſing with his Law, notwithſtanding Chriſt's death, for him not to execute the Law upon us, though an honourable diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Being a Satisfaction, a refuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble payment, God may take off what part of the penalty He and his Son agreed, from the offender, and leave on him what part they pleaſe, and as long as they pleaſe and judg meet: And indeed, though they did agree, and God hath promiſed for Chriſt's death-ſake, that they who perform the Goſpel-condition, ſhall not periſh, but ſhall have eternal life: they ſhall not undergo eternal ſorrows, Hell-ſorrows; yet they never agreed, and God never promiſed that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhould not be afflicted for their ſins in this life, or that they ſhould not dye temporally, or that the ground as to them ſhould be freed from that firſt curſe; or that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40303:49"/> Women ſhould not undergo pain in Child-bearing; for theſe things God doth inflict: therefore the Son in paying the ranſome, and the Father in accepting, never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed they ſhould be freed from them in this life; though yet they did, ſo to moderate and help in them, and ſanctifie by them, that a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an life in this World is worth living. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 22.

Puniſhment is truly defined, the infliction of a natural evil, for a moral evil; and this is in every chaſtiſement. If a Father ſhould whip his Child, not for any fault, but only to do him good, we might poſſibly call it blood-letting, but not

And if God do puniſh his people with temporal chaſtiſements, then they are ſo far, and as to thoſe temporal chaſtiſements, unpardoned; ſo far as they are puniſhed, ſo far they are unpardoned. If a Traytor be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but muſt loſe ſome part of his Goods, he is then pardoned as to his Life and Lands, but not as to that part of his Goods. It is not leſs abſurd to ſpeak of chaſtening for a fault never committed, than for a fault perfectly and every way par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. You may ſee how this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers theſe difficulties: If it be a Satisfaction, he may pardon the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, as to their ruin and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by their ſins, and yet leave ſome part of the penalty on them, that may make their hearts ake, and eyes weep; though they be as

               <p n="3">3. If the Sufferings of Chriſt were a Satisfaction, a refuſable pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; then, As God is bound no further to acquit the parties for whom it is paid, than he accepting it, and Chriſt paying it, agreed: ſo (which is the main thing I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all this, to anſwer), He is bound only in ſuch a way, and on ſuch terms and conditions, to acquit the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as the party paying the price, and the party accepting of it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on.</p>
               <p>Now God did not ſet forth Chriſt a Propitiation, and Chriſt did not give himſelf a Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40303:51"/> conſiſted with God's Juſtice; yet it is certain, it was not conſiſtent with his wiſdom and prudence in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to pardon and deliver thoſe that ſhould ſlight deliverance; ſo to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt was not properly a Surety (though Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically once ſo called) who hath only a care of one party to get de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance for the Debtor, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not for the Creditor; but he was a Mediator, a middle perſon, and had care of both; would have their redemption and deliverance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuch a way, as ſhould no way diſhonour God. He had a care of the Worſhip, Service, and Honour of God, as well as of man's impunity and deliverance; and he would alſo
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40303:51"/> have a care that he ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached as an unholy Saviour; to have redeemed one to live, as if the Blood of the Covenant was an unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, and would allow them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity in all ſin. He would not for his part have his unſpotted Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to ſerve as a covering to wrap and cover wilfully continuing running ſores. Nay, Chriſt was ſo far from meerly deſigning and bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ſalvation of them that ſhould continue wilful contemners of God and his Laws; from intending his death for a Sanctuary, where wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful continuing enemies might find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge and ſafety; that his deſign was, to bring Religion into the World, and to fetch it back from that ſwoon wherein it muſt needs have lain, had not Chriſt dyed, had there been no hope for repenting returning ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. He was ſo far from meerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing the pardon of any, live they as they liſt, that one of the great ends of his death was, That purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch hope for them that return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they might purifie themſelves;

               <p>Chriſt never agreed for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of final impenitent Unbelievers, never ſatisfied for that, though he did for impenitency, and unbelief, and rejection of Chriſt for a time, provided they came in at laſt.

               <p>A man that tranſgreſſeth a Law, is immediately condemned by the Law. <hi>Adam</hi> in the very moment he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the Law, was condemned in Law; that is, made guilty, the death threatned was made due to him.

He that is a believer, that hath performed the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condition, is juſtified immediately, <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> in Law-title, by the Law of Grace; he is conſtitutively juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by that Covenant or Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant <hi>[He that believeth, ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved];</hi> hath right to not-periſhing, and a right to eternal life, by this promiſe; though he is not ſententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

               <p>And indeed, the Juſtification (in law) of faln man, is all one with the pardon of ſin. And as for the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive difference of pardon being a diſcharge from the obligation of the Law to puniſhment; and juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the condemnation and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of the Law; it is ſo little, that it is not worth while to clear it to you; for the obligation of the Law to puniſhment, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40303:57"/> and accuſation of the Law, are one and the ſame act.</p>
               <p>Juſtification of one guilty, is all one with pardon of ſin. Yet there is this difference between Juſtification taken at large, and pardon, <hi>viz.</hi> None can be pardoned but an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but a man that was never an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, is capable of being juſtified (as <hi>Adam</hi> would have been, had he ſtood) againſt any charge pleaded or pleadable againſt him. But if once a man be guilty of the breach of a Law, his Pardon and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are all one; for there can be no juſtification of offenders, but by a legal diſcharge of the ſinner from the obligation to puniſhment, which is pardon. So that Juſtification a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively taken, is an act of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he pardoneth our ſins, or diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us from condemnation, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth right to ſalvation, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our ſins. All theſe are the ſame, and only differ in words. If you ſhould define <hi>Juſtification, An act of God, whereby he pardoneth our ſins, and conſtituteth us righteous;</hi> all the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40303:57"/> fault here is only this, You do tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologize; for there needeth no more to righteouſneſs, than pardon of ſin: for that which putteth an offender into ſuch a ſtate, as if he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Law in all things, that doth perfectly juſtifie, or conſtitute him righteous: but, pardon of all ſins, both of omiſſion and commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth put a man into that ſtate, as if he had performed the Law in all things (for it putteth him into that eſtate, as if he had tranſgreſſed the Law in nothing; therefore, as if he had performed the Law in all things). It is impoſſible to find a middle. I ſay, there needeth no more to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, than pardon of ſin. If all his ſins be pardoned, he is <hi>ipſo facto non reus,</hi> not guilty; and if not guilty, he is <hi>juſtus,</hi> juſt. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to find any <hi>medium</hi>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40303:58"/> Heaven and go to Hell; if his ſin be once pardoned, this obligation once diſſolved, he is in <hi>ſtatu quo prius,</hi> hath right to Heaven, and to be free from Hell. If right to any good thing that a man ſhould have, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, ſhould yet be wanting to a man pardoned (as you may ſee I did yield ſuch a thing before as to this li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e) the want of that good thing is part of puniſhment; and therefore he is not wholly pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no more than wholly juſtified as yet, except the right to that good thing be reſtored.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, then pardon of ſin reſtoreth right to the enjoyment of God; elſe not fully pardoned, no more than juſtified. If a Traytor be pardoned, but muſt loſe his Goods, he is then pardoned and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified as to his Life and Lands, but not as to his Goods. So that they are the ſame thing, his pardon and juſtification; and there is no more in the juſtification of an offender, than pardon of ſin. Thoſe learned
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40303:58"/> men that oppoſe this, conſtantly grant, That if pardon of ſin put an offender into ſuch an eſtate, as if he had performed the Law in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, then it would appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently be the whole of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and alſo that pardon of ſin putteth him into ſuch an eſtate, as if he had offended the Law in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and alſo that the ſatisfaction of Chriſt is enough for pardon of ſin. But they maintain, that it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a man not to have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Law in any thing, and yet not to have fulfilled the Law in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing; which I ſhould by no means tell them that know it not, was it not in duty to inſtruct you, that it is oppoſed without ſhew of reaſon.</p>
               <p>And by the way you may ſee how contrary to Reaſon (as well as Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) that way of theirs is, who hold, That Chriſt's fulfilling of, and Chriſt's obedience to the Law, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, imputed, as if believers had fulfilled and obeyed the Law in his ſo doing: You may hold the active
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40303:59"/> and paſſive righteouſneſs of Chriſt a ſatisfaction to Juſtice for our breach of the Law; both of them a valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſideration, on which God will acquit the offenders, ſo they do but perform the Goſpel-conditions; and I can eaſily anſwer all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments I have read, to exclude his active obedience from being part of the ſatisfaction to Juſtice for the breach of the Law: But to hold, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and beſide ſuch a ſatisfaction for our diſobedience, that there is made over to us a right to his obedience, ſo as God to account us as if we had obeyed the Law in him; beſide the danger of making God account men as perfect as Chriſt, and accounting that which is not true;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is altogether needleſs: for the Law requireth not of us, both ſuffering and obedience, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſame time and actions, but only one of them; either our obedience, or our undergoing the penalty. And it is vainly alledged, that it requireth ſuffering for the time paſt, and obedience for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40303:59"/> It is in effect to deny Chriſt hath ſatisfied for future ſins: Ere long thoſe future ſins will be paſt; and if we do not obey for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we ſin; and if we ſin, the Law requireth only our ſuffering for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation; and that, Chriſt's Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Expiation, Propitiation, hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It maketh the death and ſufferings of Chriſt needleſs: for if we obeyed the Law in him, he being in our ſtead, ſo as God accounted us to have obeyed in him; then there was no need of his death: for though we obeyed not in our ſelves, yet we obeyed in Chriſt. If a Soldier be by the Martial Law to watch his hour or dye; if another be accepted to watch for him, ſo as it may be ſaid another hath watched for him; though he did not watch, what, Muſt this other Soldier dye for him, as well as watch for him? No Law requires both. It was not, Do this, and dye. If his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience was ſo formally for us, as to be accepted by God for us, as if we had fulfilled the Law in every
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40303:60"/> thing, What need was there of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, to make as if we had b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Law in nothing? <hi>&amp; vice verſâ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If Chriſt fulfilled the Law for us in this ſenſe, ſo as it is to be imputed to us, as if we had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Law our ſelves; then we ſhould be freed altogether from any obligation from the Law to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; juſt as we are freed from the condemnation of the Law, becauſe Chriſt underwent it as a Satisfaction for us, we ſhould not then ſin in not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying the Law, and we could not be pardoned by Chriſt for our ſins in not obeying the Law; for they are no ſins according to this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.</p>
               <p>If there be a Law, That if a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, hired for a year, ſhall refuſe to ſerve his year's ſervice (if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter require) he ſhall lye in the priſon a year. Suppoſe one hired did not ſerve a year, but another ſerved a year good and faithful ſervice for him, Muſt this hired man alſo ſerve a year for himſelf, or he is to blame?
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40303:60"/> and, Muſt this man, accepted to ſerve a year for him, alſo lye in priſon for him? What if I did not ſerve a year, yet another ſerved for me, and better ſervice than I can perform? What need is there, may he ſay, that I ſhould ſerve it my ſelf? Do I think I can mend his work? do it better my ſelf, than I have done it in him?</p>
               <p>I am almoſt aſhamed to lay open the weakneſs of them that hold theſe things, after ſuch multitudes of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Proteſtants have ſhown their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity. How much clearer is the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> way, of God for Chriſt's ſake juſtifying and pardoning us, for Chriſt's Satisfaction, Propitiation? than to talk of our fulfilling the Law; yea, or (which is not ſo ill) our ſatisfying in Him, ſuffering in Him, or redeeming our ſelves in Him, or God accounting us to have ſatisfied in Him. Theſe are Phraſes the Scripture is a ſtranger unto: though if they will ſay, as ſome, They mean no more by ſuch ſpeeches, but that God for Chriſt's Satisfaction gives us all theſe Goſpel-mercies:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40303:61"/> I ſhall only ſay, They might ſpeak plainer. And our ſatisfying in Him is true, in a figurative ſenſe, though not in a proper ſenſe; and ſo God's accounting us to have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in Him: yet, in no poſſible ſenſe is our fulfilling the preceptive part of the Law in Him, true; for, this would make Chriſt's ſatisfaction needleſs.</p>
               <p>Now ſince I have defined Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by pardon of ſin; it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that I tell you what <hi>Pardon</hi> is: Pardon is a diſſolution, or diſcharge from the obligation to puniſhment. It is none of theſe four things that only pretend to come in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Pardon of ſin is not, A ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſin ceaſe to be: for that is to be aſcribed to Sanctification, which is a <hi>real</hi> change in oppoſition to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not, making that it ſhould be ſaid, that the ſin was never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; this is impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:40303:61"/>3. It is not, making ſin that it do not in its own nature deſerve dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is not, the executive taking off the penalty; for this is a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of pardon, by virtue of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and faithfulneſs. Yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is uſed in this improper ſenſe in Scripture.</p>
               <p>But it is, A diſſolution of the obligation to puniſhment; the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the penalty is taken away immediately by pardon, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely and ultimately the penalty; God being juſt and faithful, will not inflict what is not due, what he hath made not due by his Law of Grace.</p>
               <p>So that Juſtification actively ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for God's act, is an act of God, whereby he pardoneth our ſins, or, diſſolveth the obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And then Juſtification, when taken paſſively for the effect of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, is, A diſſolution of, or diſcharge from the obligation to Hell and Puniſhment, or a right to Salvation; or, a right to be free
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40303:62"/> from Condemnation, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a right to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>It doth not, in this Diſcourſe, concern me to ſpeak of the further degrees of Happineſs ſuperadded: for, Juſtification of it ſelf compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth no more than right to what would have been due to us if we had been righteous without pardon, had never tranſgreſſed the Law: for, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is from ſome thing, as well as to ſome thing. Yet this, on the by: Greater things than we fell from, do come to man by the ſame Law of Grace, by the ſame blood of Chriſt, and upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the ſame condition, that Juſtification or pardon of ſin doth. As for the meritorious cauſe of this Juſtification, I have ſpoken very largely of it already: for whoſe ſake, merit, <hi>Cujus intuitu:</hi> I told you that he juſtifies us through the redemption that is in Chriſt; and I dare not ever and anon return to ſpeak of it here, leſt I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found your underſtandings. I ſhall, after this, ſpeak of God's working
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40303:62"/> Faith in us, that we might be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and Chriſt's meriting of it. Therefore do not in your too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoughts over-run me, as if I denied any thing I come not yet to ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>Now I will tell you what this act of God is; how God diſchargeth the ſinner, and diſſolveth this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to Puniſhment, and ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth right to ſalvation which we loſt by our ſins.</p>
               <p>It is by ſome new Law or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, by ſome Covenant or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, founded in Chriſt's Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is ſome judicial juridical act, and therefore by ſome Law-act. I thus prove it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is impoſſible that a man that is a ſinner ſhould have right to be freed from condemnation, but it muſt be by ſome Law of Grace, ſome legal diſcharge. Such a <hi>jus</hi> or right cannot poſſibly paſs, but by ſome Law-act. If a Rector ſhould refuſe to inflict the penalty on a man guilty or condemned, this is not Pardon or Juſtification. You
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40303:63"/> may call it Suſpenſion, Impunity; but the offender hath no right to the Impunity, the obligation to puniſhment is not diſſolved by it. Yea, ſuppoſe God ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved within himſelf never to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the penalty; yet he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict it when he would, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice (though I confeſs not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mutability), the offender hath no right to impunity by ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, no <hi>jus,</hi> the obligation is not diſſolved till ſome <hi>lex remedians,</hi> ſome remedying Law, ſome Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law of Oblivion, ſome Act of Pardon and Oblivion: elſe, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbearance, but no acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, no diſcharge, no pardon, no juſtification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God will be true to his own Laws, and will not leave a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed to whom puniſhment is due by his own Conſtitutions, all things conſidered; but his judgment and execution will be according to Truth and Law. <hi>He that condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 17. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>the righteous, and juſtifieth the wicked, they both are an abomination
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40303:63"/> to the Lord.</hi> He will ſentence men according to his own Laws; and he will not juſtifie or condemn <hi>pro li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitu,</hi> but according to his own decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Laws. He will not ſententially hereafter juſtifie, nor will he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count juſtified here, any ſinner, but whom the new Law of Grace, the Goſpel founded in the blood of Chriſt juſtifieth, which only juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Believers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Condemnation is by ſome Law: therefore Juſtification muſt be by ſome Law; for, Contraries are of the ſame general nature. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is by a Law-threat; ſo Juſtification of a ſinner muſt be by a Law-promiſe. It is a Law-rule, that Obligations are diſſolved by the ſame way whereby they are made. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of boaſting being excluded in Juſtification, asketh, <hi>By what Law?</hi> and anſwers, <hi>By the Law of Faith;</hi> implying plainly, Men are juſtified by the Law of Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We may clearly ſee it by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Covenants, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 9 <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribeth the righteouſneſs of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40303:64"/> the Law, the tenour of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, which would have juſtified men, had they performed the condition of it: <hi>The man which doth theſe things, ſhall live in them.</hi> But the righteouſneſs of faith, the tenour of the Covenant of Grace, the word which we preach, is this: <hi>If thou confeſs with thy mouth, and believe with thy heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Had man performed the Legal Condition, perfect and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual obedience, the Law of Works would have juſtified him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now, if a man perform the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-condition; the Goſpel, this Law of Faith, will juſtifie him. See alſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16, 17, 21, 22, of the two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants. To <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed were the Promiſes made; that is, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all true Believers that are of the Faith of <hi>Abraham;</hi> as he fully explains himſelf in other places of the Chapter, eſpecially the laſt verſe. And is the Law againſt the Promiſes of God, againſt this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant confirmed of God in Chriſt,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40303:64"/> That he that believeth ſhall live? <hi>Had there been a Law which could have given life, verily righteouſneſs ſhould have been by that Law: but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe by faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe.</hi> We may argue plainly thus: This Law, this Covenant-Promiſe, <hi>Believe and live;</hi> can give life, that is, right to life; for ſome do perform the Condition of this Law: Therefore, verily Righteouſneſs is and muſt be by this Law. Can any man poſſibly give a reaſon why that Law would have juſtified, would have given right to life, and ſo righteouſneſs have been by it, to a man that had performed perfect obedience, and not this <hi>Believe and live,</hi> perform the Goſpel-conditions and live; and not this juſtifie, give right to life, and ſo righteouſneſs be by it?</p>
               <p n="5">5. To deny this, is to ſay, the Goſpel-Promiſes are meer Cyphers and Nullities; they have no effect, if they do not give right to Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and eternal life, which is Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40303:65"/> to thoſe that perform the conditions: Nay, it is to deny that they are Promiſes; for if Promiſes, they muſt have the common nature of Promiſes, which is to give right. To deny the efficacy of them, is to deny they are gracious Promiſes; it is to ſay they are uſeleſs, as to giving the right; we ſhould have had right without them. It is no Act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, much leſs a very gracious Act of Oblivion, that doth not pardon and juſtifie properly them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Conditions of it; no Act of Oblivion to him that would be juſtified by doing that which is the condition of it without it. And this, by the way: They that ſay, Faith attaineth right as an Inſtrument, and not as a condition, make all the Promiſes Nullities; they in effect ſay, We ſhould have had right, had we performed that thing which is the condition, without ſuch a promiſe.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, Juſtification muſt be by ſome Law of Grace; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Proteſtants ſeem agreed, it is a Juridical Act. Now what Law of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40303:65"/> Grace is it? What names is it to be called by? You may call it, The Promiſe, the Covenant, the Law of Grace, the Law of Faith, the Goſpel; by theſe names it is called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The tenour of it is this: He that turneth, ſhall live: He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, ſhall be ſaved: He that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth Chriſt in the Goſpel-way, on the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> terms, ſhall have the benefit of this Propitiation to his juſtification and ſalvation, though never ſo great a ſinner. This is the Goſpel, the Law of Faith, the Law or Covenant of Grace founded in the blood of Chriſt. Theſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> in Chriſt; are the Covenant confirmed of God in Chriſt, as the Apoſtle calls them. And by this all were juſtified and ſaved, that ever were ſaved by the blood of Chriſt. You ſhall all be judged, that is, juſtified or condemned, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially, according to this Goſpel. And, as you ſhall be ſententially judged according to this Law of Liberty at the laſt day; ſo, you are here in this life conſtitutively

               </p>
               <p>I hope you now begin to ſee into the nature of Juſtification; and by ſeeing what it is, you ſee what it is not. Only theſe things following, to my beſt remembrance, are, and can with any ſhew be pretended to be called <hi>Juſtification;</hi> except what the <hi>Pupiſts</hi> pretend. That it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but <hi>Sanctification;</hi> which I pretermit as ridiculous. He would not be an abomination to God, that could juſtifie the wicked; that is, ſanctifie them, according to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ir interpretation.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:40303:66"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is not. Our knowing we are juſtified, which ſome call <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in Conſcience.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture never calleth Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance (our knowing we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) <hi>Juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We may be juſtified in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ſenſe by this Goſpel, having the condition of Juſtification, and yet not know it; yea, think we are not juſtified, and have no right to ſalvation; elſe, wo to troubled ſouls. And we may not be juſtified, and think we are.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this ſenſe we ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid to juſtifie our ſelves, and not God to juſtifie us: for it is we that know we are juſtified, by the act whereby we know it; and not God, though God enable us to know we are juſtified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Juſtification is not, God's knowing we are juſtified, and have right to Impunity, right to Heaven: it is not God's knowing, accounting us, judging us juſtified: for we are firſt juſtified, pardoned in order of Nature, though not of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40303:67"/> Time, before he knows, accounts us ſo be. We firſt have this right to Impunity, Salvation, before He knows or accounts us to have it. The Object is in order of Nature before the Act; a thing is, before it be known. If there be an Act of Oblivion made, upon condition of Rebels laying down their Weapons; Offenders are pardoned, juſtified in Law-title, upon laying down their Weapons, in order of Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, or any elſe, know or account them pardoned. God doth not account men's ſins pardoned, till firſt they be ſo by his own Law of Grace. <hi>They that juſtifie the wicked, or condemn the righteous, are both an abomination to the Lord.</hi> As God did not account <hi>Adam</hi> guilty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, till firſt he was ſo, by his own Law, through ſin; ſo he doth not, will not account any juſtified, pardoned; till firſt they are ſo by his own Law of Grace made in the Blood of Chriſt, which is upon their performing of the Condition of it.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:40303:67"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Juſtification is not, God's knowing we ſhall be juſtified. God indeed doth know men ſhall be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified when they believe: but this is not Juſtification. It doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that a man is juſtified, and his ſin pardoned, who is going on in all villany, becauſe he belongeth to the Election of Grace, becauſe God knoweth he will believe, and ſo will be juſtified when brought home. For, 1. God knoweth, till he believe, he is unjuſtified, his ſin not pardoned, he is under the curſe of the Law, and under the Rectoral diſpleaſure of God: for, <hi>Without Faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> God hateth all workers of iniquity with this Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hatred. <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already;</hi> he is ſo far from being juſtified. You cannot ſay of ſuch a man, he is juſtified, his ſins pardoned, but he knoweth it not. No; till a man believe the wrath of God abideth on him. Hell is yet his due, by God's own Laws of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; though Heaven will be ſo, when he believes. 2. Elſe Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>that we may be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt. To whom righteouſneſs ſhall</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Juſtification is not, God's intending, decreeing, willing that men ſhould be juſtified when they believe. 1. Then it would be from Eternity; which is repugnant to all Scripture: God ſpeaketh of it as a thing future. God intended from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, That our King ſhould be King of <hi>England;</hi> but he was not King of <hi>England</hi> till his Father was dead, and then h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the legal
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40303:68"/> Title. 3. God's intending from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity to condemn men for their ſins, is not Condemnation; elſe men would be condemned from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but, then men are condemned when they ſin, and the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns them. So, God's intending to juſtifie ſinners upon believing, is not Juſtification: But, when men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, then God juſtifieth them by his Law of Faith. 3. To ſay, This is meant by Juſtification, is to make non-ſenſe of all thoſe places of Scripture that make it future. When he ſaith, <hi>God will juſtifie;</hi> we muſt then ſay the meaning is, <hi>He will will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifie.</hi> We muſt double the word <hi>will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Some tell us, That Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is properly and formally Chriſt's ſuffering or obedience, or properly God's laying our ſins on Chriſt. But then we muſt ſay, Chriſt never merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our pardon or juſtification; we are not forgiven for Chriſt's ſake: for, Chriſt never merited th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe things which they call Juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> his own ſufferings, or our ſins laying on him.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:40303:69"/>
               <p>Could you think of any other thing to call <hi>Juſtification,</hi> beſide what I have here taught you, I could with much eaſe ſhew you the abſurdity of it. Theſe are the likelieſt of any I can think of, to pretend to be it; that are not it, and are pretended by ſome to be it.</p>
               <p>You now ſee, or may ſee, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is God's Juridical Act by his Goſpel, by his Law of Grace. If an Act of Oblivion be made on theſe terms, That whoſoever of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels ſhall go and promiſe before ſome Juſtice of Peace, they will be loyal Subjects for the future; as ſoon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they have thus promiſed, this Law juſtifieth, pardoneth them. They did not pardon themſelves (that is a fooliſh pretence of ſome weak men, contrary to the knowledg of all Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and Divines, yea, of any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men), but the Law-giver did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them by this Rectoral Act of Pardon upon their promiſe. If there be a Law in force, that every Felon ſhould dye: but there is alſo another remedying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Law, That if the Felon
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40303:69"/> read, he ſhall not dye: When he readeth, the Law pardoneth him; the Law-giver by this Law juſtifieth him from the charge and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the other Law.</p>
               <p>It is by this Goſpel, this perfect Law of Liberty, that we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; this is that new Law that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are ſent to preach: <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every creature. He that believeth, ſhall be ſaved. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> This is our great buſineſs, To tell men the condition on which they ſhall be pardoned, juſtified, and ſo ſaved. And ſhould any Miniſters be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their great Meſſage? yea, ſo ignorant as to ſay, Theſe are no conditions, no terms, nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us in order to attaining<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the benefit of Chriſt's death? How ſad ſhould this be to us? Men are juſtified or condemned here in this life, by this Goſpel, in a Law-ſenſe; and, in this ſenſe, Scripture for the moſt part uſeth the word <hi>Juſtifie;</hi> and men ſhall hereafter be juſtified or condemn'd ſententially according to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40303:70"/> this Goſpel. Thus I have told you what Juſtification is; which was the firſt Queſtion propounded to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: and I have tacitly ſlidden into the ſecond Queſtion, What the Covenant is? and anſwered that. The third propounded was, To tell you what the Condition is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What is meant by this, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Him that believeth in Jeſus;</hi> or, <hi>Him that is of the faith of Jeſus.</hi> This is the Queſtion now to be anſwered, What is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant of Grace, of the Law of Grace, on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of which this Propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this price of Redemption ſhall be ours, for our juſtification and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? Ours, I ſay, with this limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>[For our juſtification and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation];</hi> or, to ſpeak more ſtrictly, The condition of our juſtification and ſalvation by it: For, God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver giveth us intereſt in his Son's Merits and Satisfaction in its eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al nature, but only in the fruits and effects of it. He giveth us his Merit only in ſuch a ſenſe as a man be
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40303:70"/> ſaid figuratively to give a Captive a ſum of money, which it may be the Captive never handled, never had it given to him at all properly, but only it was paid to the King of that Countrey for his ranſome.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: What would you wiſh or deſire it ſhould be? Think of that a little; for that is it, I dare ſay, if you think or deſire rationally. Should God ſay, O ye guilty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, I have found a Ranſome; I have found out a way that I can now par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don you with ſafety to my Honour and Juſtice. Now, as ingenuous men, ſpeak, and tell me, what I ſhall do for you? Should I pardon you, and give you Heaven and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though you ſhould continue to live in all Villany, hating me and my holy ways, ſlighting my Law and Government? We would anſwer, No. This would not become the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and univerſal Magiſtrate and King of the World; this would be unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God: For, then we might ſay, We are delivered to commit all theſe abominations: this we have
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40303:71"/> begun to do, an nothing will be reſtrained from us which we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to do; and there will be none to put us to ſhame. Speak then like honeſt men that have ſome ſparks of ingenuity. We ſhould ſay, Make not the terms perfect obedience; for, we brake that old Covenant that had theſe terms, when, we had our perfect ſtrength; and now we are weakned wonderfully, ſhattered wonderfully by our fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Make the condition, the terms this: That if we, humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging our deſert of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, repenting us of our iniquities, and ſeeking to thee for forgiveneſs, ſhall ſincerely deſire and endeavor to pleaſe thee, and keep thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſhall bewail it with grief when we fall ſhort, and fail in this our duty, that then we ſhall have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this Propitiation: So that only our wilful choſen caſting off thee and thy Government, ſhall undo us. And make it, that though we ſhould have long refuſed thee, yet if at length we thus repent and return, we ſhall find this mercy.</p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:40303:71"/>
               <p>This is well ſaid thus far: And though this be not now enough for us, yet this ſeemeth to comprehend all the condition required of men to juſtification and ſalvation, before the appearance of Chriſt in the fleſh. There were Promiſes of Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Juſtification, and right to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, made known to the World by <hi>Noah</hi> the Preacher of Righteouſneſs, and others, upon the condition of repentance and returning to God. <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> was ſaid to a great ſinner. This was Goſpel, not Law; for that requires that a man never have been a ſinner. The Book of <hi>Job</hi> is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally with reaſon held to be written before the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and his Friends knew and taught this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and name it as coming from the Ancients by Tradition, <hi>If any</hi>

                  <hi>becauſe of diſobedience;</hi> and ſo the Margent of your Bibles have it, alſo <hi>ver.</hi> 11. And the Apoſtle tells us what Faith was neceſſary in thoſe days, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5, 6. <hi>Enoch</hi> had this teſtimony, that he pleaſed God; but <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God: for he that cometh to God muſt believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> It is eſſential to Religion, to believe there is forgiveneſs with God, that he may be feared. The Goſpel-condition is rather the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſeeking of Him (if you will place it in one of theſe acts only) than the believing he is, and is a rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them that come to him: for, this may be without that ſeeking, but not that ſeeking without this. I think it was not an eſſential condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Juſtification and Salvation in thoſe days, to have an explicite knowledg and belief of Chriſt's death and ſatisfaction, though God did pardon them upon their return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40303:74"/> unto him upon the account on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that <hi>to come</hi> Satisfaction. And that which is like a Mathematical demonſtration to me, that it was not an eſſential condition of pardon and ſalvation, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> If it was an eſſentially neceſſary condition of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification then, then no man could be in a ſtate of juſtification and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, without an explicite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Chriſt's death and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to come. But the Diſciples of Chriſt (at leaſt ſome of them) were truly regenerate men, truly children of God, and in a juſtified eſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt's Reſurrection, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it not. That they were truly the people of God, and in a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied eſtate before his reſurrection, is clear; for ſaith Chriſt (before that), <hi>You are clean, through the word I have ſpoken to you.</hi> And it is ſaid of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel, A true Iſraelite, in whom is no guile.</hi> And elſe we muſt ſay, God had no people in the world at that day; for you will confeſs, they were the beſt. And again, it is apparent they did not believe any ſuch thing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40303:74"/> as his death, and paying a price of blood. Nay, they were ſo far from believing he ſhould ſo dye, that they rather believed that he ſhould not ſo dye. When ever he ſpake any thing of his death, it is ſaid, <hi>They un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 23. Mark 9. 31, 32 Luke 9. 44, 45<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Luke 18. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>none of theſe things:</hi> and, <hi>Far be it from thee:</hi> and when dead, they thought it unlikely that he ſhould be a Redeemer: <hi>We truſted this was he that ſhould have redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Iſrael.</hi> They looked on him as the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> but thought he was to be ſome great Temporal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, and his Redemption ſhould be with <hi>Power,</hi> and not with <hi>Price.</hi> How then could they be ſaved, if they had then died? I anſwer: That they, as others before them, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God would pardon ſinners upon their repentance, and returning from ſin unto God; but for whoſe ſake or merit they knew not.</p>
               <p>I do not here deny but ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them might and did know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chriſt's death and Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation: and I do not deny, it was their fault they knew no more, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40303:75"/> underſtood no more the Types and Propheſies of him: but all that I contend for, is this, that it was not a neceſſary condition of ſalvation; elſe the Diſciples had not been in a juſtified eſtate. And I may add this, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was under a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſpenſation than they before him, and the leaſt in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a clearer than <hi>John,</hi> and ſo the Diſciples in a clearer than <hi>John.</hi> Hence it is very probable, If the Diſciples knew not any thing of it, very few before them did, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under more obſcure Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and had not the helps they had. Now ſuch repentance, ſincere obedience, and turning, is ſtill a part of the Goſpel-condition: for, this is not taken away now under the Goſpel; it is as much a condition of the Covenant, as ever, <hi>That we take God for our God, and turn from ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Will any man ſay, That Miniſters are not to preach from thoſe Texts, <hi>If the wicked turn from his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he ſhall live.</hi> And, <hi>If you live after the fleſh, you ſhall dye; but if
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40303:75"/> you through the ſpirit do mortifie, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe things are as much a condition as ever. But there is ſomething ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under the Goſpel, ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us as neceſſary, that was not ſo to them. Now, <hi>if you believe not I am He, you ſhall dye in your ſins.</hi>

It is ſit there ſhould be faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as well as repentance toward God: That he ſhould
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40303:76"/> ſave only thoſe that come to God by him, and ask in his Name: That over and above being true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in whom is no guile, there ſhould be a belief of Chriſt, and his death and reſurrection. And ſo indeed there are new Articles eſſential to our Creed; <hi>Except you believe I am he, you ſhall dye in your ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, This is the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condition: God ſaith to us as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to <hi>Adonijah</hi> (when fled to the horns of the Altar): <hi>He deſerves to dye; but if he will ſhew himſelf a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man, not a hair of his head ſhall fall to the ground: but if iniquity be found in him</hi> (if he will be falſe and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous to me and my Government) <hi>he ſhall dye.</hi> It is ſeemingly too high an Alluſion; but the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment often uſeth the word <hi>[worthy]</hi> for carrying in our weak meaſure ſuitably. I mean however no more but this; Be but Chriſtians in good earneſt; believe the truth of the Goſpel ſtedfaſtly, in ſuch a degree as to venture all upon it; and love God and Chriſt heartily, and ſerve
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40303:76"/> them according to your weak ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ability faithfully, ſo that it ſhall be the real grief of your ſoul when you fall ſhort; and this ſhall ſerve your turn. So the terms are the whole of Chriſtianity, the whole duty of man, ſo far as integrity and ſincerity. What doth <hi>Solomon</hi> mean, when he ſaith, <hi>Fear God, and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole duty of man,</hi> but the whole condition of happineſs? Doth he ſet us on any thing not required under the goſpel? Theſe are the terms of the Covenant of Grace, eſtabliſhed in the Blood of Chriſt, which you ſhall be judged, juſtified, or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by; and they are juſt before God, are juſtified in Law, that do thus; and ſhall be ſententially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced juſt, that do thus in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, though not perfectly; and they that do not, ſhall be condemned, notwithſtanding Chriſt's death. Such only are of the Chriſtian Faith. I underſtand Faith thus largely; and it is plain the Scripture doth, when ever any promiſe of Juſtification is made to it.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:40303:77"/>
               <p>Do but well conſider theſe few things following, to remove preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and to let you ſee into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things; and I hope you will eaſily be convinced what are the terms.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are the ſame terms and conditions of Juſtification and of Salvation. Whatſoever is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the one, is alſo of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For, the Apoſtle argueth in the ſame manner againſt ſalvation by works, as juſtification by works. Yea, it is apparent in the nature of the thing: for, Juſtification paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken (as I told you before) is nothing elſe but right to ſalvation; and we need no more for Heaven, than right to it. Do but get and keep right to Heaven (which is Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification), and we need no more on our part. As for poſſeſſion, that is God's work, by his Angels, carrying away ſouls, raiſing bodies. Many worthy men have ſaid, That Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſincere Obedience, are only for Poſſeſſion, and not for Right. But we are not to work for Poſſeſſion at
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40303:77"/> all; we need not get upon a Hill, when about to dye, to ſave the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels a labour of carrying our ſouls too far. Do but get and keep Right, and to deny Poſſeſſion to us (if we have right to it by Promiſe) would be unfaithfulneſs in God; which we need not to fear. Therefore if you will grant, that all the things I have ſpoken of, are required neceſſary to ſalvation, then they are alſo to juſtification. Only ſtill, it is here, as in all other things of like nature, Conſent, hearty conſent to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-terms, immediately inſtateth us in Juſtification, and right to Heaven. But if we would have continuance of our Juſtification and right to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we muſt continue to conſent to thoſe terms, as to the ſincerity of our hearts and endeavours; elſe we ſhould loſe our Juſtification and right to Heaven; and the reaſon why we ceaſe not to be juſtified, is becauſe God keeps us from depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him, by keeping in us care and watchfulneſs. Thus we ſee what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we may lawfully do for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40303:78"/> the ſame we may lawfully do for Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whatſoever duty there is, that if we do not, we ſhould have no right to ſalvation, or juſtification, that is a condition of our ſalvation and juſtification. It is too common a ſaying, and a great upholder of the <hi>Antinomian</hi> way: Do but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſay ſome, (and by believing, they do not mean as I do, the whole of Chriſtianity; but ſome one act, as, believing my ſins are pardoned, or reliance, or accepting Chriſt for my Saviour) and ſuch acts as accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Chriſt for Lord, and ſincere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience will follow; but they are not conditions of Juſtification and Salvation; but put that one act, and they will naturally and inevitably follow. But ask them, Suppoſe they do not follow? They will anſwer, You muſt not ſuppoſe it, they will; for, they dare not ordinarily ſay, That if they do not follow it, you will yet have right to Heaven. I will ſhew you the vanity of ſuch talk. This is virtually to ſay, God
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40303:78"/> never made promiſe to theſe as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, never ſuſpended ſalvation on them, but they will follow faith naturally. This is to ſay, Godlineſs hath not the promiſe of this life, or however not of that to come; elſe it would be a condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. The inſtance that is uſually brought of it, is this: There cannot be a ſeeing-eye without the body; yet it is the eye that only ſees. So Faith only is the Condition, only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains right, but cannot be without works. Now I will bring this to make it like the caſe in hand: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one promiſe you ſuch a reward if you bring him, and give him the ſeeing eye of ſuch a Beaſt; we are ſure (if the meaning be according to the words) you would have right to the reward, if you brought him a ſeeing-eye without the body; though indeed you cannot: yet we are ſure, if you did, you would have right, and he would be unjuſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying you the reward, though you brought not the body. And on the contrary: Suppoſe we be ſure this
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40303:79"/> is a truth, If you ſhould bring him a ſeeing-eye, it would not attain right without the body; Then we are equally ſure, that we miſtook his words or meaning, he ſpake <hi>ſynec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochically:</hi> for then it is equally a condition that the body be brought, as that the ſeeing-eye be brought; and it is equally influential into right: for, come to thoſe things that do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and univerſally accompany and follow one another, and where but one of them is made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the other not; the abſence of that which is not a condition, would no way hinder right; and ſo not right to Juſtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If a man become a Chriſtian indeed, it naturally and inevitably follows, he ſhall be hated of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men; but God never ſuſpending Juſtification and Salvation upon it, never making this a Condition, we may truly ſay, If a man be a ſincere Chriſtian, it would not hinder his juſtification and ſalvation, though the wicked did not hate him. So if it be true, that a man cannot be a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40303:79"/> true Chriſtian, but he muſt eat, drink, and breathe; theſe are natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants: yet theſe not being made Conditions, though he did never eat, drink, nor breathe, he ſhall be ſaved. If you can ſay of any Grace, or any meaſure of Grace, as Aſſurance, or Joy, That it is not neceſſary to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and ſalvation: Then only you may ſay, They are not Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe. If any one beloved ſin, knowingly and wilfully conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in, would hinder a man's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, juſtification, or right to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; then a ſincere deſire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, according to his ability, to get rid of that beloved ſin, is a Condition of his Pardon and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All Conditions of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Salvation, are equally Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, equally influential into right. If only an accident, or mode of a thing, be made a Condition with the thing; it is equally a Condition with the thing it ſelf. If one promiſe to bring me a white Horſe, and you ſhall have ſuch a reward: It is
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40303:80"/> equally a condition, and as much influential into right, that it be White, as that it be a Horſe; ſo in any inſtance you can bring, either in fact or fiction. If I promiſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon condition you bring me a Hundred, and you bring only Ninety-nine; you have no more right than if you brought none; and the odd one is as much a Condition as Ninety-nine. If any ſhall ſay, The Condition is a working Faith; then, that it be working, is equally a Condition, and equally influential into right, as, that it be Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is no ſuch thing as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Righteouſneſs, or Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Pardon. Many make this their great ſtrong hold. Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and ſincere Obedience, are not receptive, receiving Graces, as Faith is; and ſo cannot receive Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Righteouſneſs. Now this falls; for, there is no act of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving theſe, Juſtification, Right to Heaven, Righteouſneſs, <hi>cometh,</hi> on Men. <hi>The free gift came upon all to juſtification. As by the offence of one,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40303:80"/> judgment came upon all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi> As condemnation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon men without any act of receiving it, it is a reſultancy from the Law upon diſobedience; ſo Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, Right to Heaven, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultancy from a Law-promiſe (the condition being performed) I know you may object that place,—<hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from darkneſs to light, that they may receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> But one of an ordinary capacity may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is a figurative expreſſion (becauſe in natural things, where there is giving, there is receiving): for, if once men be turned from ſin to God, Pardon comes by virtue of God's Promiſe; and Right to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance cometh on them. And we may figuratively ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> received his condemnation by eating: And ſo we read in Scripture of receiving condemnation; but there was, in propriety, no act of receiving it. If I make a promiſe upon ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; as ſoon as the condition is performed. Right to him reſults with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any act of receiving it. Right
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40303:81"/> comes upon the Felon that reads, Right to have his Life ſpared; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, Pardon to Life comes upon him by the Law, by reading, without any act of receiving it. Many tell us of applying Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to Juſtification; and this is all. It is an obſcure ſpeech; and it is, you ſee by this, impoſſible there ſhould be any ſuch thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. I will tell you what I gueſs they mean by the word <hi>[apply] viz.</hi> Meditating upon any Truth you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. And they mean the ſame by <hi>[acting faith], viz.</hi> Meditating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Truth we believe. This is a great duty, to meditate on his Death, to act Faith upon his Satisfaction, and the fulneſs of it; to draw our hearts to conſent, and chear our hearts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſent: But if once they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it is Meditation they mean, they will not ſurely pretend it is the only Condition of Juſtification. You may ſay indeed, That Faith recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Chriſt: But then you muſt not mean, by Faith, Aſſurance, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for, Why doth not Love, or
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40303:81"/> Fear, or Hope, as much receive as reliance? But you muſt mean the moral receiving, performed by the natural act of conſent, acceptance. As one receives morally ſuch a man to be his Maſter (that deſires his ſervice) by conſenting; and if you will ſay, Faith is Conſent; why is not Conſent to be ruled by him, giving up our ſelves to be ruled by him, as much a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt, as Conſent to be ſaved and pardoned by Him? And then if you will but grant this, this is to grant all I am pleading for. For, Conſent to have him for Lord and Saviour, is to conſent to be Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to conſent to perform the whole duty of man; which is as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive a word as can be ſpoken, to be made the condition of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and juſtification: and if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the whole duty of man to the beſt of our power and knowledg be the condition of begun-Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Salvation; then you will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſee, that continuing this Conſent, continuing to be Chriſtians indeed, and to perform the whole duty of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40303:82"/> Man, to the beſt of our knowledg and power, in the integrity of our hearts, and wherein we fail to lament it, is the condition of our continued ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and right to ſalvation. If a King grants a Pardon to Rebels, on condition they will become Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subjects, Conſent is enough at the firſt to attain right to all the benefits of it: But continued Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and continual loyal carriage (in the main) towards him, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their continued right to Impunity; and every moment of continued Loyalry, is, in order of nature, before their continued Right. So, whereas before we conſented to the Goſpel-terms, our Pardon, and Juſtification, and Right to Heaven, were only offered to us upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and were not actually exiſtent at all: now when we have heartily conſented, they are really exiſtent and actual, not meerly conditional; ſo that ſhould we dye in that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhould be ſaved, whereas had we dyed before we ſhould have periſhed. But yet the continuance
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40303:82"/> of our Juſtification, and pardon of future ſins, is ſtill conditional.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is a groſs miſtake that many take up with, thinking it would be a more gracious, liberal, and free ſpeech and promiſe, to ſay, Only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, rely, accept Chriſt for Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and you ſhall have right to Heaven, and be juſtified; and I will require nothing elſe of you for right to Heaven: This believing ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be influential into your right; but yet, except you repent, turn from ſin to God, and obey, you ſhall have no right, ſhall not be juſtified; than to ſay, Turn from ſin to God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, believe, obey, and you ſhall have right to ſalvation. For ſuch a ſpeech as the firſt, inſtead of being a more noble free promiſe, is non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, is untruth, and a contradiction in the very words: It is to ſay and unſay; it is to ſay, All ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually influential into right, all ſhall be Conditions, and yet they ſhall not all be Conditions, and equally influential into right. For, a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that, which if we do not, we
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40303:83"/> ſhall have no right to the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. This is a Condition as much as any Condition, and as influential into right as any condition in the world that is not the whole conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for, every condition is only a <hi>ſine qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> non,</hi> and altogether only <hi>ſine quibus non, &amp; cum quibus.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for any to ſpeak thus, is weakly to lye for God, pretending to keep up the honour of God's free grace; ignorantly thinking, that if God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to repent, return, or no mercy, then it is not free; then we merit our pardon; it is not of grace: contrary to all Reaſon and Scripture.</p>
               <p>God hath made the Condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from us, as little, as ſmall a matter as he thought would ſtand with his Honour, Wiſdom, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the World; and they that would make the conditions of Grace, Mercy, and Salvation through Chriſt, leſs than God hath made them (what ever good intention they have to honour God by it) do really diſhonour him as an unholy God: for God thought it would not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40303:83"/> ſtand with the honour of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to accept unto favour and life any but they that ſhould return from ſin unto God. Miniſters are to tell the whole terms, that men may ſit down and conſider the coſt; and if men will be offended, and ſay it is a hard ſaying, and like not Chriſt and Life on theſe terms: Let them be offended, they have their choice to let him alone; but they ſhall know, they had life and death ſet before them on gracious eaſie terms; and they have rewarded their own ſouls evil for good. Again, if a neceſſity of Repentance and ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Juſtification, would hinder it from being free; then ſuch as ſay thus, and tell us, theſe things are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for poſſeſſion; do virtually grant, that poſſeſſion of Salvation is not free: But what Chriſtian-ears can endure this, that Poſſeſſion is not equally free with Right, that both are not of free-grace?</p>
               <p n="6">6. They that ſay, There is only one act to be done by us for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Juſtification, and Right to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40303:84"/> and whoſoever ſhall do any other duty or act for theſe ends, ſeeks to be juſtified by works, in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſenſe: They make it a certain damning ſin, to do any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act that we may be pardoned, juſtified, obtain right to Salvation. For that certainly was it which the Apoſtle wrote againſt. Now <hi>quae ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium probant, nihil probant;</hi> that which will prove more than they, upon deliberate thoughts, dare grant that uſe the argument; that anſwers it ſelf as to them. Surely they dare not own what inevitably follows from this. Then it follows, that no man muſt pray for pardon of ſin, upon pain of damnation; for this is to do one act more for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than that one act. No man muſt repent for this end, That his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be blotted out; that is, for Juſtification. No man muſt by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory and immortality; for, then he muſt be damned: for, ſurely well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing comprehends more than belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, when they take it for one act;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40303:84"/> but God hath ſaid, To ſuch only he will give eternal life. No man muſt do the Commands of God for this end, That he may have right to ſalvation: If he do, he ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed: whereas God ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rev. ult. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What? hath God made promiſe to repentance, returning, ſincere O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, of Pardon, Juſtification, Heaven; and ſhall we provoke God if we perform the condition for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the benefit, and expect the benefit upon performing the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Would not this be as rational, to threaten death for ſin, and yer be angry at us for fearing his threat, for avoiding the ſin upon the account of his threat? as to be angry at us, yea, (according to this principle) damn us for performing the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Promiſe, that we may have right to the thing promiſed? There is no poſſible avoiding this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: for, if you may act for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, then for right to the reward: for you are not (as I ſhewed before)
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40303:85"/> to act for Poſſeſſion any further than for right to it. And if any ſhould object, But you muſt not expect Juſtification and Salvation to come by theſe; this would be to ſay, You muſt think God unfaithful, and his Promiſes nullities; and we are apt to be too diſtruſtful herein without bidding; or, but you muſt not think to merit by theſe things. Very true; but is it impoſſible to perform them for theſe ends, but we think to merit by them? Do they that ſay, they may do the one act of Believing for Juſtification, think they merit Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by it?</p>
               <p>Sure I am, that many that held theſe things notionally, did not hold them practically: for many of the worthieſt men, both Prelates and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that ever <hi>England</hi> had, held theſe things notionally, yet ſo as to deny the conſequence; but never any good man held them practically, I mean except juſt in a ſudden fit of temptation.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now yet more fully make out to you what this Goſpel-condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40303:85"/> the Covenant-terms of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Salvation, and all other benefits by Chriſt are, (for they have all the ſame condition, every Covenant-benefit or any Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benefit) by reciting ſome of the moſt eminent Names the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condition is called by; which is an eaſie matter to do: and ſome may think it as well let alone, as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. But the thing I am ſpeaking of, ſeems to me to be as weighty a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as any point in Divinity, and is oppoſed by many; and therefore it ſhall not be grievous or burdenſome to me; and for you, I think it ſafe and needful; and let the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent pardon my uſing ſo many words, yea, and Tautologies, ſince I do it that the loweſt-parted may underſtand me, and doubt no more.</p>
               <p>That Condition which we are to be juſtified and ſaved by, is called by many Names, which yet always mean the ſame thing for ſubſtance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is called Knowledg, <hi>By his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 53 11.</note> 
                  <hi>knowledg ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many.</hi> Knowledg here is taken
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40303:86"/> objectively, not ſubjectively, <hi>viz.</hi> for our knowledg of Chriſt, not his knowledg whereby he knows. So, <hi>This is life eternal (i. e.</hi> the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life) <hi>to know thee and thy Son;</hi> but it meaneth alſo, Love, Believe, Obey, and carry ſuitably to ſuch Knowledg.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Goſpel-condition is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Confeſſion. <hi>If we confeſs, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins.</hi> So, if any man ſay, <hi>I have ſinned and perverted that which is right, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth me not, he will deliver his ſoul.</hi> But the meaning is, <hi>Si caetera ſint pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> Confeſs ſo, as to forſake, obey, &amp;c. Elſe if God meant no more, by theſe Promiſes we ſhould have right; and he would be unfaithful in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying us poſſeſſion, though we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake not our ſins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometime it is called Faith. <hi>The righteouſneſs of Faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe;</hi> that is, the Goſpel, the Law of Faith, in oppoſition to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works. <hi>If thou confeſs with</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>thy mouth, and believe in thy heart, that God hath raiſed him from the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40303:86"/> dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> What doth he mean no more than you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſt is riſen? Nay, you muſt believe he is aſcended into Heaven alſo; yea, and believe the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and obey and carry ſuitably to the Goſpel alſo: The Goſpel-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which is a ſincere endeavour according to the beſt of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, to perform the whole duty of man, is frequently called by the name of Believing, in the New Teſtament; becauſe it was the great buſineſs at that time, to perſwade the Jews and Gentiles that Chriſt was the Meſſiah, and that he roſe again. There were new Articles now added to the old ones, new Conditions to the old. They take it for granted as a thing known, that they were to repent and obey, that they knew the duty of repentance toward God. But this was the great difficult Doctrine, to perſwade them there was a neceſſity of Faith in the Lord Jeſus, and to believe his death and reſurrection. <hi>Try the ſpirits, for many falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are gone out into the world</hi> (and <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 1, 2, 3.</note>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:40303:87"/> gives this as a trial of the Prophets), <hi>every ſpirit that confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is of God: but he that confeſſeth it not, is not of God.</hi> We may take this as a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interpretation of the place. He takes it for granted, that they knew, they that taught wickedneſs and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry were not of God, whatever confeſſion they made of Chriſt. But his meaning may be; If any coming as a Prophet, ſeeming to be a man teaching Holineſs; he is not of God, if he deny Chriſt come in the fleſh: but if he add to other ſuch virtues, Faith in the Lord Jeſus, he is of God. You may eaſily apply it to the caſe in hand. And whatever inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation elſe you will give of this, as confeſſing Chriſt in time of trial; yet it muſt be meant, <hi>and teach ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to ſuch confeſſion.</hi> What do you think the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> meant, when they ſaid, <hi>If we let this man alone, all men will believe on him?</hi> What did they mean, ſome one act, and that one act that many now hold to be only neceſſary to ſalvation, though
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40303:87"/> not agreed ordinarily what it is? Surely they meant, They will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he is the Meſſiah, and ſo love him, obey him, ſtick to him. If one bid you believe in ſuch a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, truſt in him, and he will cure you; cannot you eaſily underſtand he means alſo, Take his Counſel, follow his directions, by believing in him? So when he ſaith, <hi>Believe, and thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> he meaneth, Believe, and carry as one that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; love, obey, turn.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sometime called Repentance. <hi>Repent, that your iniquities may be blotted.</hi> John <hi>preached repentance for the remiſſion of ſin.</hi> Surely, you will grant, that is for Juſtification. And Chriſt did not take away this Condition; nay, he preached it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: <hi>Except you repent, you ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> He meant, believe, obey alſo.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Called Converſion.—<hi>Turn them from darkneſs to light, that they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 4. 12</note> 
                  <hi>may receive remiſſion. Leſt they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and be converted, and their ſins ſhould be forgiven them.</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:40303:88"/> Implying the terms that God hath bound himſelf to by promiſe through Chriſt's death to the world, ſo as he cannot in faithfulneſs break. If con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, he muſt forgive, having made this new Law of Grace.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Called Obedience. <hi>Being made perfect through ſuffering,</hi> having fully ſatisfied, <hi>he became the Author of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation to thoſe that obey him.</hi> Surely this holdeth out the terms on which men ſhall have the juſtifying ſaving benefit of Chriſt's death. But there is implied in this alſo the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the truth of the Goſpel. So, <hi>Hear and your ſouls ſhall live.</hi> That is, obey for life, for juſtification, for right to ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Keeping the Commandments. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they may have right to the tree of life. Not the hearers of the Law are juſt before God, but the doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified. Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord; but he that doth the will of my Father, ſhall inherit the Kingdom. If the</hi>

               <p n="8">8. Regeneration, New Creature. <hi>Except a man be born again,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Not by works of righteouſneſs which we have</hi>

               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:40303:89"/>9.

               <p>I have ſet Life and Death before you, and told you the condition of Life by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Would we go and conſider this condition, and the reaſonableneſs of it, and the glorious things that would come by it; and would we go, and in the ſtrength of God and Chriſt, call Heaven and Earth to record; yea, and Hell to witneſs, That we conſent, give up our ſelves to be ruled and ſaved by Chriſt; would we enter into Covenant to be the Lord's people, and his Chriſt's, to walk in all well-pleaſing, and not to allow our ſelves in any known ſin, or in the neglect of any known duty; and to uſe the means God hath appointed to know his will, and for the deſtruction of ſin; and this as honeſt men really intending per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance even till death; being ſo far from deſigning treacherouſly to turn aſide in difficulties, that it is our greateſt fear and dread, leſt we ſhould deal falſly in this Covenant: From this time you are juſtified by this Law of Grace, and have right

So a man that never maketh theſe Suppoſitions, [If I ſhould fall away, I ſhould loſe all] cannot but be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unwary and remiſs in care and watchfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Concerning thoſe ſeveral Names the Goſpel-condition is called by, let me add this Obſervation. I know ſometime theſe words may be, and are uſed in Scripture in their proper ſenſe, for one act, and no more. And it may be ſometimes by <hi>confeſs,</hi> may be meant no more than <hi>confeſs.</hi> And ſometime <hi>Faith</hi> is uſed only for <hi>Faith;</hi> as when he ſaith, <hi>He that cometh to God muſt believe that God is:</hi> There, by believing, is meant only aſſent: And ſo when we read of Faith's operativeneſs, it means only the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Truth (and ſo would I be underſtood, when I at any time ſpeak of Faith's operativeneſs, as purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hearts by Faith); yet when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any Promiſe is made to any
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40303:91"/> Grace or Act whatſoever of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Salvation, Pardon; there it implieth the whole Goſpel-conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all Graces eſſential to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. It muſt be underſtood, <hi>cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris paribus,</hi> if other things anſwer thereto. And this I can prove evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to you by this argument; elſe a man would have right by the Promiſe upon his Confeſſing, though he did not forſake; and, by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that Chriſt is riſen from the dead, though he ſhould refuſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Goſpel; and God would be unfaithful in denying him the things promiſed. If you promiſe a <hi>Vintner</hi> ſo much money to ſend you ſuch a Butt that ſtands in his Cellar, and he ſends you the empty Veſſel; if you can aſſure me that you are not by truth and promiſe bound to pay him, then I am equally ſure, that you meant the Veſſel and the Wine alſo: you ſpake <hi>Synecdochically.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Methinks I may ſay as the Town-Clark of <hi>Epheſus</hi> once did, with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reaſon than he, <hi>Theſe things are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, things that cannot be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Is not this, working for Juſtification, or Righteouſneſs? Is there no danger in ſeeking to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and ſaved by works?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No danger at all in this ſenſe; and yet great danger in another ſenſe: but it is ſo far from being dangerous in this ſenſe, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary to ſalvation: <hi>They only ſhall be bleſſed that keep his Commandments,</hi> in Goſpel-ſincerity, <hi>that they may have right to the tree of life;</hi> that is, that they may be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. And I dare confidently ſay, that never any did ſincerely obey God (whatever confuſed notions ſome good men have had in their brains, that they held only ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively), but for this end, among others, that they might have right to Heaven, which is Juſtification; for as humane nature now is (and I think I may ſay the ſame concerning the ſtate of Innocency), it is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of undergoing the difficulties of obedience, but for ſuch ends, To
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40303:92"/> eſcape the curſe, and attain the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; which is to attain Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and eſcape Condemnation. And to ſay otherwiſe, is to ſay, God hath indeed made promiſes of remiſſion of ſins, and Heaven, to thoſe that repent, turn from ſin, and obey the Goſpel; but I will not regard theſe promiſes, I will not be moved by them, I will do none of theſe things for theſe ends; but I will only act out of love. Which yet, I could ſhew you, would be impoſſible: For, how can I love him who I think hath done me no good? and, how can I think he hath done me any good, when I think my own ſalvation is no good? as I certainly do, if I do not deſire and endeavour it. And God hath threatned thoſe that go on in ſin, with a Curſe, and Hell. But I will not refrain ſin for theſe ends, that I may eſcape Hell; I will only act out of Love; I will be above Scripture; I will neither be moved with promiſes nor threats. But there is another ſenſe which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of as damnable.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40303:93"/> The Phariſaical Jews would have Juſtification and Righteouſneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pardon; would purely and meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be juſtified, ſo as not to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, that it ſhould be no favour to juſtifie them, but their due with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace and pardon; (and that maketh him prove, out of <hi>David,</hi> the neceſſity of pardon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.) and that would be in effect to ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Satisfaction and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt: and if ſo, Chriſt died in vain, this would make void his death; they would have their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Moral Law (which they commonly interpreted as reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to the outward act) either to be perfect, or ſo little defective, that the great meritoriouſneſs of being <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and circumciſed; and their ſtrict obſervance of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, and other Traditions never commanded, would make up what wanted: And their Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs being compleat of it ſelf, their Juſtification would be of due debt from the old Law, through Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and not of Pardon and Grace
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40303:93"/> through a Propitiation. And ſo too many among us look upon their good works as meritorious; though they be ſinners, and know it, yet they think the good works of Alms, and other things, which they look upon as no duties, will ſatisfie for thoſe ſins; and think God would do them wrong, if he do not for their good deeds pardon their evil deeds; think their good works are very good, and deſerving much from God; and their evil not very evil; and ſo God would be very hard, yea, unjuſt, if he ſhould condemn them. If this was true, then no need of Chriſt, he then dyed in vain; then ſalvation would be of debt from natural Juſtice, from the old Law, and not of Grace, and Mercy, and Pardon through Chriſt. Will any dare to ſay, If what I have ſpoken be true, that he will pardon none but repenting, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, believing ſinners, that it is not of Pardon, Mercy, Grace, but of debt from the old Covenant, which allows no Pardon?</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:40303:94"/>
               <p>I confeſs <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles about Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification are hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; and I am confident many Expoſitors are, and have been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly miſtaken about theſe things; and that by Faith he meaneth (as I do) Faith and Obedience to the Goſpel. I have written ſomething to ſhew to my Acquaintants the meaning of theſe places, which I think make them appear rational and plain to this ſenſe, and <hi>(abſit verbo invidia)</hi> will do ſo to ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men. But it is not fit to ſpeak ſo largely here. I wiſh you to read conſiderately, <hi>Cap. 3. v.</hi> 5. of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to <hi>Titus.</hi> Can you imagine when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Chriſt, we have believed that we might be juſtified, &amp;c.</hi> That he means, we did not repent that we might be juſtified; did not obey, turn from ſin, that we might be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, or not be condemned? All that I will do here further, ſhall
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40303:94"/> be to ſpeak ſo as to keep you from dangers on both ſides, if you will obſerve this diſtinction, and it will be plain I hope to the meaneſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
               <p>There is in this Juſtification by Chriſt ſpoken of, (there being two Laws or Covenants, one of Works, and the other of Grace, a <hi>lex re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medians,</hi> and both in force; elſe if the old Law, as a Law, with its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, was repealed, it would be no ſin not to obey perfectly; and we might ſay, Chriſt his death had not ſatisfied for our ſins, and the legal deſert of them, but prevented them from being ſins, and from legally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving damnation) there is in this Juſtification, as it were, a two-fold Righteouſneſs or Juſtification; and the diſtinction of theſe two is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to any competent meaſure of underſtanding this Doctrine of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and would be ſo helpful to make us underſtand it, and ſpeak intelligibly of it, that I deſire you would never forget it: Paſſive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, the effect of active, is our
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40303:95"/> right; conſtituted as I have ſhewed you. But to ſpeak of active Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, It is eſſentially from ſome Charge pleaded, or poſſibly pleada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble againſt us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Suppoſe the Accuſation be, We are ſinners, have offended God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved wrath, broken the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Law of Works: and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this are comprehended ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel; for they are ſins againſt the Moral Law, which Chriſt hath ſatisfied for all the breaches of, that ever were or ſhall be. For the Original Law of Nature is this, <hi>Keep all my Commandments which I have or ſhall reveal to thee any way what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, whether by Nature, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of making my will known</hi> (the eating of the forbidden fruit was againſt this Moral Law, though immediately againſt a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation) <hi>or thou ſhalt dye.</hi> Now if this be the Accuſation, thou art a ſinner, haſt deſerved death, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the Law, refuſed Chriſt and the Goſpel a long time; yea, and haſt notoriouſly ſinned ſince conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:40303:95"/> Here nothing will juſtifie, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will anſwer this Accuſation, but this: Chriſt hath dyed, ſatisfied; God hath ſet him forth to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation. It would be improper and vain here to plead, We have repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, believed: for thou art a curſed Creature, and there is no blood or ſatisfaction in theſe; thou wilt rather be damned for thy failings in theſe; they are imperfect at beſt, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cannot buy off thy former ſins. Here we muſt plead nothing in our ſelves to this Accuſation: nay, we muſt confeſs we have nothing in our ſelves to juſtifie us againſt this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of being ſinners, deſerving wrath. That that muſt anſwer this Accuſation, is altogether without us. To plead, to juſtifie from this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, ſomething within us, is to ſpit in Chriſt's face, is damnable: for whatever we plead, muſt be a Righteouſneſs, or it is no way pleada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If we have a Righteouſneſs to anſwer this, Chriſt dyed in vain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But now ſuppoſe another Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation which is poſſibly pleadable
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40303:96"/> againſt us: ſuppoſe the accuſation be, But thou haſt no lot or porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Satisfaction; for all have not intereſt in it: but there was a ſecond Covenant made, wherein God made it over only upon Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-terms, and conditions of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, believing, obeying ſincerely, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſincerity and uprightneſs, and truth in the inward parts: for, it was enacted that none ſhould have the benefit of it, to juſtifie them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the old Law, but they that performed the condition.</p>
               <p>Here now is no danger of plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to anſwer this Accuſation, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our ſelves; nay, it is duty, and we wrong our ſelves if we have the condition, and do not. Ye muſt ſay, Yea, through grace I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, believed, endeavoured to obey God ſincerely, and have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented when I have faln ſhort; I have received Chriſt for my Lord and Saviour, &amp; endeavoured to ſerve him, and do at this day. And this will be your righteouſneſs againſt this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, will juſtifie you againſt this Accuſation.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:40303:96"/>
               <p>It would be fooliſhly impertinent to plead here, Chriſt hath dyed, hath made ſatisfaction to the Law; when the Charge, the Accuſation is, Thou haſt no intereſt in him, and his death, and the purchaſed bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. And it would be falſe and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to plead what they that falſly are called the only Preachers of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace would have you plead, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt hath repented for thee, performed the Goſpel-conditions for thee. Here you may and muſt plead ſomething in your ſelves, even the performance of the Goſpel-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. You muſt not confeſs you have nothing to plead, except you have not; and then I would ſay, Are you mad wilfully to refuſe Chriſt? I know, men may think they have not, and yet have this condition; and then God knows, there is this good thing in them toward God and Chriſt, though they think not ſo; and ſo they are juſtified, and know not. But if you ſay, I have nothing in me to anſwer this Accuſation, and ſay true, and continue in this eſtate;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40303:97"/> you will be condemned upon this Accuſation at the laſt day, when judged according to the Goſpel, and are at preſent under condemnation in law.</p>
               <p>But if you be ſincere Chriſtians, and in ſome comfortable meaſure know it, you may in this ſenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in your ſelves; you may ſay, I have proved my own work, and ſo have joy in my ſelf, and not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>This is our rejoycing, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Conſcience, that in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in this world.</hi> You may ſay of a godly man, he hath that within him that will bear him out, and mean by it the ſincerity of his heart; but then you muſt not mean it to ſatisfie for his ill deeds, or againſt the firſt accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but againſt this only, of having no part in Chriſt. Here a man may glory; <hi>Let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he underſtandeth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me,</hi> Jer. 9. 24. We may ſay in the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>'s ſenſe and words, Our
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40303:97"/> hearts, our conſciences acquit us, and condemn us not. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 20, 21. <hi>If our hearts truly condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us not, then have we confidence toward God; and whatſoever we ask, we receive of him, becauſe we keep his commandments, and do thoſe things that are pleaſing in his ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that you may now ſee, that 1. God juſtifieth as the principal Efficient. 2. The Promiſe or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God <hi>(If thou believe, thou ſhalt be ſaved)</hi> as the inſtrument, or leſs principal efficient: for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is eſſentially an efficient; and the act of the principal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument are eſſentially one and the ſame act, and both proper Efficients of the effect. If one ſtrike with a rod, he ſtrikes and the rod ſtrikes, though leſs principally, yet both truly. If a man promiſe, he gives right, and the promiſe gives right properly. 3. Chriſt's Death and Merits juſtifie as a Satisfaction to God's Juſtice, that he might pardon
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40303:98"/> with ſafety to his honour and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. 4. The faith of Chriſt, or true Chriſtianity as the condition. Now a condition is a <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non;</hi> and it is agreed that a <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non,</hi> is no cauſe, but only ſo neceſſarily called for want of a better word; juſt as we are forced to ſpeak always of <hi>non-entities,</hi> as if they were <hi>entities</hi> whenever we ſpeak of them, as <hi>Tenebrae ſunt, Nihil fuit.</hi> So I was wittingly forced, ſometimes before, to uſe the word of <hi>Faith's influence into right.</hi> And it is almoſt impoſſible to ſpeak o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but any intelligent man may ſee, though the performance of the Goſpel-condition ſeemeth at the firſt view to have ſomething like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into right, like cauſality, yet it hath not; but that influence which it ſeemeth to have, is to be aſcribed in propriety only to God and the Promiſe. When a Felon reads, it was not his reading that pardoned him, but the Legiſlators by the Law upon his reading. So that they err that uſe to tell us, that Faith is a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40303:98"/> cauſe of Juſtification, and not other graces; for it is no cauſe, it doth not in propriety juſtifie and pardon our ſins at all. If Faith did merit, then it would be a moral efficient of our right. Methinks none ſhould ſay, Faith is an Inſtrument of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; for then it would be a true proper ſaying in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, Faith pardoneth our ſins, Faith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitteth us.</p>
               <p>You have ſeen upon what honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable terms God hath diſpenſed with his Law in not executing it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever not fully executing it upon offenders.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He doth execute ſome of it in this life upon his pardoned ones, pardoned as to the great matters: for Chriſt did not bargain, that the curſe ſhould in every part be taken off immediately upon their belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. No, God makes ſin evil and bitter to them in this life many ways; and they muſt dye, and their bodies rot in the grave for a time. God told <hi>Moſes,</hi> he had pardoned the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> (that is, ſo as not to cut
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40303:99"/> them off from being a people); <hi>but as truly as I live, all the earth ſhall be filled with the glory of the Lord, their carkaſſes ſhall fall in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And I doubt not, but this tends to the honour of God's Juſtice, to leave ſome drops of this curſe upon us in this life; and we ought to take notice of his righteouſneſs, as well as mercy in afflicting us.</p>
               <p>Some will object, But the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Believers are not ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I know they are not in the ſtrict ſenſe of the word: for that ſignifieth compenſation enough for the fault; or, in the ſenſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts uſe the word, For little Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings buying off other Sufferings; yea, the great or eternal ſuffering. And ſome object, They are not vindictive; and when they explain the word, they mean, they are not eternal or totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive; which is true indeed. But if any by the words <hi>Satisfactory</hi> or
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40303:99"/> 
                  <hi>Vindictive,</hi> mean, that they are not inflicted by the Rector by virtue of the Law for a fault, in token of his diſpleaſure, and for the honour of his Juſtice, and warning of others. I muſt deny it, and ſay, So far as they are for ſin, they are ſatisfactory and vindictive in this ſenſe; and can plainly prove it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which God hath and will take off (as indeed all will be clear taken off at the great, full, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Redemption, the Reſurrection of the body) Chriſt hath paid deer for it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though Chriſt hath paid this great Price, yet we ſhall have this benefit by it, only upon ſuch terms of honour to God, as acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in deep ſenſe of our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, God's righteouſneſs if he had condemned us, and turning from ſin, accepting the Redeemer. Methinks we ſhould be ſo far from quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at, that we ſhould ſee high rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for, and admire the wiſdom of God in this whole Tranſaction; and while we ſee ſome of his ways are
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40303:100"/> rational, conclude all are ſo, and our ignorance is the cauſe they appear no more amiable to us.</p>
               <p>Here is no ſhadow of injuſtice in the Univerſal Magiſtrate of the World, neither to Chriſt, nor to Chriſtians, nor to the Commonwealth of the World, nor to his old Law that was not executed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No wrong done to Chriſt: for, he underwent it willingly, <hi>Et violenti non fit injuria;</hi> No wrong can be done to a mind willing of the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not to Chriſtians: The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt praiſes are due to God from them, and given by them, for this very tranſaction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not to the World: It was to reform it, and lay a new foundation of Religion in it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Not to his Law: For, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of that hath been as well ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and kept as inviolable by the revelation of this to be adored Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, as if it had been exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon all offenders to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:40303:100"/>
               <p>I will anſwer but one Objection more, before I come to apply all.</p>
               <p>Some will expect to hear, how this whole Doctrine is conſiſtent with Election and Special Grace.</p>
               <p>If you ask men of different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions concerning general and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, How it comes to paſs that any of the degenerate ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> are ſaved? They will anſwer, Only by Grace and Mercy through Chriſt. If you ask them further, How comes it about that ſome are ſaved, and ſome periſh, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Grace? They will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer, Becauſe ſome believe, perform the Goſpel-condition, others not. If you demand, How comes this, that ſome perform the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condition, and not others? They will ſtill concent in anſwering, Some will, and ſome will not; ſome chuſe mercy on the terms of it, and others chuſe rather to periſh than to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Chriſt and Mercy on the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terms. Thus far they agree com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly; ſo that it doth not properly concern me to ſpeak (in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe)
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40303:101"/> of the things wherein they differ; both granting all that I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. But if you enquire further of them, How comes it to paſs that ſome are thus willing, and others not? Here they diſagree: Some will ſay, this of man's willingneſs, it is to be aſcribed to man himſelf; or give ſuch anſwer that it inevitably follows from it; and that God doth no more in this caſe for one than for another; helps one as much as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and then conſequently it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that a man converted is not a jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſome doctrinally hold, That God giveth men only free-will, and the Goſpel or objective Evidence; and will go no further with any.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40303:101"/> and the Goſpel and objective evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which they have already, and hold that God will do no more for any; whereas God only diſowns reſpecting of perſons in Rectoral and Judicial Acts, as puniſhing and rewarding, as will appear upon view of thoſe places; but no where the doing that for the working the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in ſome, which he doth not for others, but owns the contrary. I dread to affirm, That a man in this ſenſe makes himſelf to differ; though man's ſin and unwillingneſs (and ſo deſtruction) is plainly of himſelf, yet not his willingneſs. And though I may well excuſe my ſelf from intermedling in theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, yet I will in ſhort give you an account of my thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. Though I doubt, ſome will ſay (which I cannot much contradict) that I had better have ſaid nothing of this nature, than ſpeak ſo little. All that I ſhall ſay of this Difficulty, ſhall be in anſwer to this following Objection.</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:40303:102"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Is not the Condition it ſelf of Juſtification and Salvation, and the working the Condition it ſelf, the fruit and effect of Chriſt's Death?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you how it is, and how it is not, in theſe Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The death of Chriſt foreſeen, undertaken, or undergone, as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation, Expiation, Satisfaction, was only for ſin, and ſo for pardon of ſin, that God might with ſafety to his Juſtice not execute the penalty, but might ſhew kindneſs and favour to offenders, notwithſtanding the Threat; and therefore, as a Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, with this kind of cauſality, cauſeth no more; and then it being agreed between the Father and Son, that only Believers (in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ſenſe) ſhould have the benefit of it for ſalvation; We can only ſay (ſetting aſide the comfortable reprieval, and the objective evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and whatever other common
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40303:102"/> helps and aſſiſtances of the Spirit there are which were neceſſary in order to trial), <hi>He gave his Son</hi> (and Chriſt, himſelf) <hi>that whoſoever repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, believed on him, ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This death and ſatisfaction, and the benefit of them offered to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners on theſe terms, are as a moral cauſe in their own nature influential to work the Condition, Faith and Repentance. The death of Chriſt (this promiſe being made with it) is an object, <hi>aptum natum,</hi> a thing objectively, naturally influential to work this effect; and ſo being the cauſe of this cauſe of Faith, it is the cauſe of the thing cauſed: for, there would have been no foundation of Religion and turning to God, but for God's being made ſo far pacified, as to accept ſinners on theſe terms, and make it known to men. But this is nothing ſingular, but common to all that enjoy the Goſpel; and it means no more but this, It would have this effect if men did their duty, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved it a right.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:40303:103"/>3. The working the Condition, the making the Goſpel actually ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious for the working the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is to be aſcribed to God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and his execution thereof, as moſt properly its effect; and uſeth therefore to be aſcribed to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, rather than the Son. Take this account of it. A foundation being laid (or foreſeen as laid) in the blood of Chriſt, that God might, with ſafety to his Honour and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, return into favour with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and that he could as Rector (and ſo would) pardon repenting returning ſinners; and that this was all he could do as Rector, with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Juſtice; he could deſcend no lower than to make this Law of Grace, this act of Oblivion, <hi>He that repenteth, believeth, returneth, ſhall be ſaved:</hi> and he muſt be true to his own Laws; it would not ſtand with his Honour to pardon any but upon theſe terms: Now theſe things, and this Law being foreſeen, and alſo fore-ſeeing that all men would yet periſh by refuſing Chriſt, rejecting
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40303:103"/> Mercy, through the wilful choſen wickedneſs of their own hearts, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the death of Chriſt for them, and the objective evidence of the Goſpel: He doth this other act I am now ſpeaking of, as <hi>Dominus,</hi> Lord Proprietary. For, as ſaving and juſtifying them that believe, is, <hi>actus juſtitiae,</hi> (the Law being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) <note place="margin">The 17th Article of our 39 Articles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, can mean no leſs than what is here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</note> a Rectoral act, ſo, as Lord Proprietary, he decreed, reſolved from eternity to, and doth in time, make and cauſe ſuch particular men (by ſetting home Truths in evidence, and ſoftning their hearts by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in a way to us poſſibly much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and not fit to be inſiſted on here) to believe, repent, return, or accept Chriſt on his own terms, whom otherwiſe he fore-ſaw would reject Chriſt even as others.</p>
               <p>I look upon this Election which is aſcribed to the Father, as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the firſt difference, of one differing from another: For, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regenerate, converted, maketh a difference, maketh men actually choice men, executively elect men,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40303:104"/> differing men <hi>(the righteous is more excellent than his neighbour):</hi> So this Decree, to give ſuch men grace, to convert them, is the foundation of this firſt difference; as having the condition of the Promiſe, maketh the firſt difference, ſo the Decree to work it is the firſt foundation of it.</p>
               <p>This is that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of as a depth to be admired, that God ſhould condemn men, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to condemn men for their ſin, that reject Chriſt and Grace; this he doth not wonder at; he could, and we can give ſufficient reaſon for that; neither doth he wonder that God ſhould ſave or decree to ſave by Chriſt thoſe that repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and not others; there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity in the thing, a Satisfaction, being that he may do it with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: But, that when all would have rejected Chriſt and Mercy, that he ſhould harden ſome, that is, leave them to the hardneſs of their own hearts, and ſoften others, make ſome repent, believe, that would have
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40303:104"/> refuſed grace, this was his wonder, and the thing unaccountable to the Apoſtle; and ſo ir is to us.</p>

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40303:105"/> as ſuch by him; for he ſaith, <hi>they ſhall come unto me, ſhall believe on me:</hi> and this belief and coming is named as the effect of God's giving men to Chriſt; and ſo the <hi>giving</hi> is antecedent to the <hi>coming</hi> in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.

               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:40303:105"/>4. Though the common ſaying is, That Chriſt's death merited no Volitions, no Decrees; and ſo his fore-ſeen death merited not, that God ſhould will ſuch and ſuch things; and the moſt build much upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> his ſaying, <hi>Deus vult hoc prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hoc, ſed non propter hoc vult hoc;</hi> meaning there are reaſons and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, cauſes of the things willed, but not of the willing of thoſe things: yet I look upon this ſaying as meer words, and void of truth; and we ought to have other conceptions, or elſe we ſhall have conceptions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of God. Yet many go in ſuch a method in ſpeaking of God's Decrees, that they make this ſuch a main Pillar of their Fabrick, that for one to hold that God's love or pity, or man's miſery, was any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to God to ſend his Son to dye (which God forbid any ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) would deſtroy their whole me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: for, it is impoſſible that any thing ſhould be, or be conſidered, as, <hi>ratio rei volitae,</hi> a reaſon of the thing willed; but it muſt be, and muſt be
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40303:106"/> conſidered, as, <hi>ratio actus volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> as the reaſon of the willing: For, a reaſon or motive is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a motive to the will of the principal Agent: for, what can it poſſibly be conceived to move, but the Will? Can it be a Motive, and move nothing? or, can it be actually a prevailing-reaſon, and not prevail with the Will? What ever God doth in time for the Merits of Chriſt, he decreed and willed from eternity to do it in time for the Merits of Chriſt: for, whatſoever God doth now in time for any end whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or upon any motive whatſoever, he decreed and willed for that end, and upon that motive, from eternity to do it. If God in time created rain to make the earth fruitful, then the reaſon why he decreed and willed to cauſe rain, was, that the earth might be fruitful. And for us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive otherwiſe of God, would be for us to conceive him to act irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, as willing things for no end; and would put a ſtop to all admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wiſdom of God ſeen in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40303:106"/> his Providence; and therefore, ſuch a conception of him would be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to him: for we ought to conceive of him in the moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable way we are able; and that is the moſt pleaſing to Him, who is above our beſt conceptions. If he condemn men in time for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of Chriſt, then he decreed to condemn them becauſe he foreſaw that they would refuſe Chriſt: If he ſave none, juſtifie none in time, but for their believing; then he willed and decreed from eternity to ſave none (with any decree or violence, that we are to conceive of, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from his Will or Decree, to work the Condition in men, that they might be juſtified and ſaved) but thoſe he foreſaw ſhould believe. And it ſeems plain, that as he abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and without condition juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth and ſaveth none; ſo neither did he abſolutely, and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, decree to juſtifie and ſave any. But God foreſeeing what an order and concatenation of things he would make, and was bound in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40303:107"/> Honour to make, notwithſtanding Chriſt's death: As in time, without Condition, (though not without means) He worketh Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, worketh the Condition in the Elect, that they may be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaved by Chriſt: So he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and decreed abſolutely, and without condition, to work the condition, the firſt Grace, that they might be juſtified and ſaved by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though Chriſt's death as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, expiation, was the cauſe of no more to us than this, That, if we repent and believe, we ſhall be juſtified and ſaved; Satisfaction and Propitiation being only for ſin: yet, conſidering this ſuffering of Chriſt, as a highly pleaſing meritorious act, as a worthy voluntary undertaking for the Honor of God we may ſay, Chriſt did merit that God ſhould give this Faith, work this Condition, and keep it in the Elect: for all would, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this (and the eaſie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable terms made of their intereſt in it) through their own wilful wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40303:107"/> have periſhed; and he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that his blood ſhould not thus far be loſt, as water ſpilt on the ground; but that he ſhould have ſome fruit of the travel of his ſoul, in ſeeing a Seed, actually to honour, venerate, and adore their Redeemer. Though I muſt ſay, for the honour of our Redeemer in this great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, He will have ſome reward in thoſe that periſh, in that he did a wonderful kindneſs for them, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only through their own choſen refuſal, that they had no benefit by it. His Goodneſs and Grace is not therefore no Grace becauſe men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it. And to do a good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious act, is a reward and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in it ſelf. And you may as well maintain, That, except God be ignorant, and know not that men will reject his mercy, he cannot be righteous and juſt in puniſhing them for it: which is contrary to the knowledg of the whole world; as to ſay, Except God be ignorant, and know not that they will through their wicked wilfulneſs refuſe his
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40303:108"/> Mercy, his Grace and Mercy is no Grace and Mercy. If one of you take a long, tedious, and hazzardous journey, to diſſwade your friend from ſomething you hear he deſigns to do, which you know will undo him, though he wilfully perſiſt, and will not be perſwaded by you, and ſo is undone by it; yet he is bound to thank you all his life after, and your kindneſs ceaſeth not to be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and you have this ſatisfaction and reward, You did a kind act, though he reap no benefit. And ſuppoſe you might have prevailed with him, if you had there ſtayed longer with him, and taken more pains; yet your kindneſs ceaſeth not to be a kindneſs becauſe you did no greater kindneſs; ſince that which you did, would have been enough, had it not been for his wilful obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy: And his after-ruing of his own folly, bears a loud teſtimony to, and tends to the honour of your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Oh that I had hearkened to my Friend! How have I hated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and would not incline mine
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40303:108"/> ear to him that inſtructed me? They in Hell, if they would and could do as befits them, or as Chriſt hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from them, would ſpend time as well in admiring the love of God, and the Redeemer, in this wonderful once offered and urged Kindneſs, as in ruing that they loſt it through their own choſen wilful madneſs. Some go on ſuch grounds in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe things, that (holding to their way) they muſt neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſinners in Hell will ever rue, and befool themſelves for their loſs of ſalvation by Chriſt: But if any will hold ſo much power in man to receive Chriſt, as that they will rue it as their madneſs, and folly, and ſin, to reject him, and periſh by ſo doing; I can from that demonſtrate (as clearly as I can do any thing) that this I now ſpeak in this digreſſion inevitably follows. Let me but ask you this, Was there no cauſe for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> (when faln from the benefit) to thank God for making that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Obey</hi> and <hi>Live;</hi> when as God might have annihilated him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40303:109"/> his obedience, had it not been for that promiſe? And do you never thank God for it, though God knew he would fall? But to return: As Chriſt's ſufferings did not as an expiation or ſatisfaction, but as a highly meritorious act, deſerve or obtain, that God ſhould give greater things to thoſe that believe, than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> loſt, for the honour of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and of this great work of Redemption: ſo, he did deſerve, that God ſhould cauſe ſome to believe; and ſo from eternity his death, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen or undertaken, was a cauſe, a meritorious cauſe or motive why God would, that is, decreed, to make ſome, and ſo, though more remotely, ſuch particular perſons, the Elect, to accept offered mercy and Chriſt, which they would otherwiſe (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) have rejected. Some call this, the Covenant of Redemption; but it is an immanent act, and from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and an elicite act of the will; and therefore is properly a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and belongeth to the Will of Purpoſe, and not to his Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40303:109"/> Will, his Rectoral Will. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks you may ſee hence, how it cometh to paſs that we ſometimes read of Chriſt's dying for the world; and in other places, that he laid down his life for his ſheep; ſometime, <hi>taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death for every man,</hi> dyed for all; ſometime again, <hi>gave himſelf for the Church;</hi> in one place, <hi>a Saviour of the Body;</hi> in another, <hi>a Saviour of the world.</hi> He dyed for the Elect and World both, ſo far, <hi>that whoſoever ſhould believe on him, ſhould not periſh;</hi> but for the Elect, as they which were much in his eye, being thoſe who certainly ſhould believe, and ſo be actually ſaved. Though God and Chriſt did, as one ſaith, <hi>aequè</hi> intend this ſatisfaction, a propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conditionally applicable to every one; yet he did not, <hi>ex aequo,</hi> as fully intend it for to be actually applied to every man. There is much of truth in that frequently cited paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Ambroſe, Chriſtus paſſus eſt pro omnibus, pro nobis tamen ſpecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter paſſus eſt.</hi> Like that, <hi>a Saviour of all men, eſpecially of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>

               <p>Will any dare to ſay, Here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of grace or kindneſs to the World? Joh. 3. 16. <hi>He ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life.</hi> V. 17. <hi>For God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved.</hi> Cannot you ſee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here what is meant by the World, and that his firſt coming was to ſave it, though his ſecond will be to take a ſevere account? V. 18. <hi>He that believeth on him, is not condemned; but he that believeth not, is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned already, becauſe he believeth not.</hi> Can you ſay, a ſick man dyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he took not ſuch a Medicine; when, if he had taken it, it would not have cured him? You cannot ſay, the Devils continue to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe they reject Chriſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if they ſhould accept him, they would ſtill periſh; for there was no ſatisfaction made for them: And may not the ſame be ſaid of them that periſh, if no ſatisfaction be
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40303:110"/> made for them? So <hi>John</hi> 12. 47. <hi>If any man hear my words, and believe not</hi> (ſurely you will ſay this is meant of a non-elect man) <hi>I judg him not; for I came not into the world to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the world, but to ſave the world.</hi> Which reaſon would have no ſhew of reaſon, except Chriſt came to ſave that man, except he be one of that World he came to ſave. If Election and Redemption were of the ſame latitude and ſtrictneſs, you might as well ſay to ſinners, Repent, for you are elected, for you are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in the Scripture-ſenſe, for you are given to Chriſt by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in that ſpecial ſenſe; as, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for you are redeemed, Chriſt dyed for you; <hi>you are bought with a price: therefore glorifie God with your bodies and ſpirits, which are his:</hi> But the Apoſtle would not venture to ſpeak thus, You are elected; therefore repent, glorifie God: for he ſhould have ſpoken what he knew not to to be true.</p>
               <p>I will ſay no more but this here: Whether is it a more likely way to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40303:111"/> lay a foundation for Religion in the World, to encourage and draw mens hearts to repent, return, to tell them Chriſt hath dyed for you, and hath obtained this of the Father for you, That if you return, you ſhall live, notwithſtanding all your former ſins; or, to ſay, Repent, return: for, for any thing you know, Chriſt hath dyed for you; for any thing you know, he hath obtained this from God, That if you turn, you ſhall live; though it is ten to one he hath not: or however, we cannot tell whether he hath or no. And if he hath not, then as this is true, that if the Devils ſhould repent and return, they ſhould yet periſh, becauſe no Satisfaction was made for them; ſo if you ſhould repent and believe, you ſhould yet periſh, becauſe no Satisfaction made for you.</p>

I know ſuch moral things conſiſt not in a point; I dare not therefore ſay, He could not pardon the leaſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence without a Satisfaction, or ſuch a great Satisfaction: It is enough to ſay, He could not pardon ſuch and ſo great ſins as ours and the worlds, upon repentance, without Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Many men of renown of late days, have in this too much ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized with <hi>Socinus,</hi> and have maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that God could, if he had ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, have pardoned the world, and received them on the Goſpel-terms into favour, without a Satisfaction: and that the death of Chriſt was from the Will of God, and not from
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:40303:112"/> his Juſtice; and ſome of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents have thus ſpoken. Now to prove, that we muſt not conceive his puniſhing-Juſtice as meerly a free act of his Will and Wiſdom; that he might as well do otherwiſe, but as a virtue or rectitude inherent in his nature.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40303:112"/> thoughts of him than we have of ſome men. It is as neceſſary for us to conceive God to do that, which we cannot better conceive and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, than by ſaying and conceiving, He croſſed a ſtrong inclination, in not executing the Law upon Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders themſelves, through a ſtronger inclination of love and pity to man, not to execute, but to provide and accept an offering; as it is neceſſary for us to conceive of God, as one croſſing a ſtrong inclination of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to his Son, in offering up his dear Son. And whatever vain and bold diſputers may ſay to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it is our duty ſo to conceive, and we pleaſe God in ſo concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and there is truth in the main in our conception, notwithſtanding the inadequateneſs of our Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for, we ſhould have ſinful and falſe apprehenſions, if we ſhould conceive it was all one to God; and that it was altogether, or almoſt, indifferent to him, whether he pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh the Offender himſelf, or no; or whether he offer up his Son or
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40303:113"/> no; or whether man periſh or no.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The very Heathens knew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Natural Juſtice of God by the light of Nature, as we read <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 32. which could not be, if the deſerved Condemnation (there mentioned) came meerly from the free-will of God, and not from his nature: for things of his Free-will can only be known by a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Will, and not by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How can his Juſtice be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated? By an act which his Juſtice requires not? What weakneſs would it be for a Prince to affect a name of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, in doing thoſe things he might indeed juſtly do, but to the doing of which he was no way bound in Juſtice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. If he could well enough, and juſtly and honourably enough, have pardoned offenders without, but choſe to ſhew his Juſtice and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſin, in the death of his Son, it would be to demonſtrate and make a ſhew of ſomething that is not in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40303:113"/> reallity. To affirm this, would be to accuſe him of <hi>Pageantry. Socinus</hi> and <hi>Crellius</hi> themſelves, that deny God's eſſential Juſtice, yet ſay, that he cannot with ſafety to his Juſtice and Sanctity, ſave impenitent ſinners. What is this but to grant what they deny, even an eſſential Juſtice? They grant in this ſo much, that it ſeemeth wilfulneſs in them not to grant all. To let go that which is with much ſhew of reaſon inſiſted on by ſome, That all would have been impenitent without the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; ſurely, the reaſon why He cannot pardon impenitent ſinners, is, becauſe this mode of ſin, contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in it, is ſin: and where then will any fix, and ſay, Hither he may go in pardoning without Satisfaction, and no further? See the Apoſtle here going further, implying, that he could not have juſtified, ſaved repenting believing ſinners, without this Propitiation, <hi>that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth</hi> &amp;c. And the Apoſtle argueth a neceſſity of ſatisfaction by Chriſt's
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40303:114"/> death, becauſe ſin could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have been taken away; plainly implying, that repentance would not have taken it away, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 4. And how weak would his Argument be, to prove a neceſſity of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, becauſe it was impoſſible the blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould take it away. If it might be taken away without any expiation at all, why then not with ſuch low things?</p>
               <p n="5">5. God is ſaid to commend his love and kindneſs to us, <hi>in that, when we were ſinners, Chriſt dyed for us:</hi> but what great love could there be ſhewed, if there was no neceſſity of ſuch an Expiation? There was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed wonderful love, if Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired our blood, for his love and pity to overcome, and ſwallow up ſuch inexorable fury! to find out, and give for us ſuch a Ranſom! But if Juſtice no way required it, What great Love would it be? In ſuch a caſe it might indeed be Love, but not eminent ſtupendious Love, To pardon: for, he obliges leſs by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning, that may eaſily pardon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40303:114"/> diminiſhing the repute of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or doing himſelf (as it were) any injury; and he obligeth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth the more, that forgiveth that which is ſo contrary to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Juſtice, and Honour, that there needs ſo great and atrocious a Satisfaction, as putting out, or tormenting the Apple of his own Eye, his dear Son, to make Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if no ſuch thing was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, then to pardon in ſuch a dreadful way, as by the death of his Son, would not be an act of mercy, or of love, but of wiſdom, if of any thing; if that indeed may be called <hi>wiſdom,</hi> to give up thus his Son without neceſſity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It ſeems contrary to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs of God, when he might go ſo eaſie, and near, and plain a way in pardoning ſinners, to go in ſo difficult a way, and in a way ſo far about; for then it was a large digreſſion to flee to a Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. And ſurely God that doth not afflict men meerly becauſe he will, would not afflict his innocent <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 33</note>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:40303:115"/> beloved Son, meerly becauſe he will, if he could, without reluctancy, without grating on his Juſtice, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and Honour, have ſcattered our ſins as a Cloud, with an eaſie breath of his mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But may not one juſtly part with his own right? Can there be any injuſtice in pardoning a Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor without Satisfaction? And is not he more to be commended that doth it without any Satisfaction? May not a party offended forgive a wrong againſt him? If one threaten to beat a man that deſerves it, may he not juſtly paſs it over without any ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He may; and I grant all. But the things I am treating of, are not Debts, but Offences; and theſe not offences againſt private perſons, as ſuch: God is (as moſt hold) the Governour of the World, neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eſſentially; however we are ſure he hath taken on him the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of it: and although it had
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40303:115"/> been a free act at the firſt to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, yet when he hath once un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken it, he by ſo doing obligeth himſelf to govern it wiſely, holily, and righteouſly; to puniſh offences, and not to let things run at random. And God is not to be conſidered as a private perſon, that pardoneth as a party offended; or as a Creditor, that parteth with his own right; but as the publick Judg and Governour of the World, who is, by taking this place upon him, engaged to judg and rule righteouſly, and to render to men according to their works. There is a wide difference between Pecuniary debts, which one forgives as a private man; or injuries done to a man in particular, which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives as a private man: and Criminal offences againſt Law and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A Magiſtrate, being alſo in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother reſpect a private man, having a private intereſt of his own, may, as other men, forgive things which belong to his profit, as Debts; and may forgive injuries and affronts done to him, ſo far as they prejudice
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40303:116"/> his private Intereſt: But he may not juſtly (however, ordinarily) forgive things which belong to his Office and Duty, incumbent on him as Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to puniſh, in vindictive Juſtice: for hereby he would be wanting in his duty, and alſo guilty of viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the authority of his own Law and Rule, and of undoing of the Commonwealth by lenity and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p>I know, a Rector or Governour may in ſome caſes diſpenſe with, and not execute his Law: For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Laws are unjuſtly made; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time about low petty matters, that do not much concern the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal to have them executed; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it would tend to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Community, to execute them, though not unwiſely made at firſt; and ſometime he wants power to execute them, the offenders being too numerous, or too potent; and ſo it may be his duty to pardon and diſpenſe with the penalty without any more ado: <hi>e. g. Saul</hi> intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally made a good Law, threatned
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40303:116"/> death to any that ſhould eat before the evening, that he might obtain the greater conqueſt over his flying Enemies: <hi>Jonathan</hi> his Son tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth it; <hi>Saul</hi> reſolves to execute the Law; the people hinder him, and reſcue <hi>Jonathan:</hi> now <hi>Saul</hi> could not execute the Law for want of ſtrength; for the people are the ſtrength of the King. And there ſeemeth to be much reaſon in what <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſaid. It was an ill Law, and proved a hinderance to the ſlaughter of his enemies; and in what the people plead, to wit, That he might well diſpence with this Law, as to <hi>Jonathan,</hi> becauſe he had wrought with God that day a great ſalvation. There was indeed ſuch a deed done by him that day, ſuch a high meritorious act, as would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a partial, if not a total ſatisfaction: So that it would not much weaken Government, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Offendors, take off from the repute of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Rectoral Juſtice, to pardon one in ſuch a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:40303:117"/>
               <p>But a Rector cannot without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, ordinarily, and in weighty cauſes, diſpenſe with his Laws; ſince it would be, To be wanting to his duty: and it would certainly tend to the debauching and ruin of the Community, by breaking the reins of Government, and encouraging Offenders. It is ordinarily as much the duty of the ſupream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, to execute good Laws, or ſome way to keep them ſacred and honourable, as it is to make, good Laws; for, both duties are built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame foundation. Who will ſay, That Parents may juſtly, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and honeſtly, caſt off all care of correcting their Children for their faults, and leave all things to their wills? This would be, not ſo much a parting with their right (as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ſpeaks) as a ceaſing from, and being wanting in their duty and office; and God's Rectorſhip and Government, is to be conceived of by us, analogically to an Office.</p>
               <p>2. Hence learn the Excellency and Satisfactorineſs of the Chriſtian
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40303:117"/> Religion, and our great felicity in living in theſe laſt days and ſhining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days of the Son of Man, wherein the Earth is, and hath been filled with the glory of the Grace and Mercy, and of the Juſtice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of God, in compariſon of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer days. The Chriſtian Religion diſcovers plainly to us, that which the Heathens were fearfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildred about. They had Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſin, and terrors and conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of mind for ſin, <hi>and fearful lookings for of judgment and fiery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation:</hi> They knew, that they that did ſuch things as they did were worthy of death; they ſaw need of <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 31</note> attoning God, need of an Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſome of them ſaw, the blood of Bulls and Goats could not take away ſin: Some offered (not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they did) the <hi>fruit of their body for the ſin of their ſoul;</hi> when they might be flying and hovering about (in their meditations and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after theſe things) like <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s Dove, and find no reſt; We have this ſafe Ark of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40303:118"/> and Satisfaction of Chriſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and opened to us, where there is Reſt for the ſole of the foot of our ſouls. When their ſoul drew near to the grave, and their life to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer, they had none to tell them of ſuch a Righteouſneſs, ſuch a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>The Heathens had indeed ſome obſcure wavering knowledg of this fundamental Article of Religion, the Remiſſion of ſins; partly by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in ancient times was more convincing; in after and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter days, more obſcure and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: partly by the Law of Nature in the Book of Providence, ſeeing the goodneſs and benignity of God to them, notwithſtanding their great provocations, they might and did thence waveringly gather, That God was merciful, and would be found in mercy of them that did turn and ſeek him diligently. <hi>He left not himſelf without witneſs, in that he did them good, and gave them rain from Heaven, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſeaſons, filling their hearts with
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40303:118"/> food and gladneſs;</hi> and this was, <hi>that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 14. 17. &amp; 17. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>they ſhould ſeek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him.</hi> But this knowledg was ſo weakned by the contrary arguments that militate againſt it, That that very deep apprehenſion of God's Holineſs and Juſtice, and thoſe very conſternations of mind for ſins, which were likely to conduce, in working this repentance and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, would be very apt much to weaken, if not almoſt to blot out this notion, That there was hope for them, and forgiveneſs with him that he might be ſerved and feared: That it is no wonder if it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual to work this change, and theſe diligent enquiries after God, and that Salvation which they were not fully ſure was attainable; though yet it was their hainous ſin, and high irrationality and madneſs, not thus to ſeek him (though to the undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelves in this life) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe probabilities and half-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes <hi>[if haply]</hi> and <hi>[it may be if we turn we ſhall live]</hi> and this will
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40303:119"/> be their greateſt condemnation. It is no wonder if never any did, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and thoroughly, turn from ſin to God amongſt them (ſince Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was quite worn out, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſuſpicious and unconvincing) without ſome ſupernatural Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as by the Prophets and their Writings. I ſay, ſince Tradition loſt or corrupted: for, in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, <hi>Abraham</hi> thought it probable there might be fifty righteous perſons in <hi>Sodom,</hi> though it proved indeed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; and he was better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſtate of thoſe times than we are at this diſtance. And to come to the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſt's time, that had the Oracles of God, and to whom the Lord ſent Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, riſing up betime, and ſending them, becauſe he had compaſſion on them ſaying, <hi>Turn and live.</hi> And <hi>If the wicked turn from his wickedneſs, and keep all my Commandments, be ſhall live.</hi> Yet it is next to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, but that thoſe amongſt them that knew little or nothing of this great price or Satisfaction, that
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40303:119"/> ſcarce underſtood any thing of their Propheſies, Types, and Sacrfices; but that thoſe ſhould have muddied and fluctuating thoughts about this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, when deeply convinced of God's Holineſs and hatred of ſin, and of the hainouſneſs of their ſins, how it could ſtand with his Juſtice and Honour to give eternal life to ſuch unworthy wretches, upon their repentance and poor broken obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Good hearts, ſenſible of God's Holineſs, and the hainouſneſs of ſin, would be apt to ſay, Though he will pardon ſin, yet it may be not ſuch great ſins as ours. What unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arguments taken from God's Juſtice and Holineſs, might they ſeem to have againſt it! No wonder if they, that knew ſo little of this great Tranſaction, though ſincere ones, were all their lives ſubject to bondage, through fear of death. No wonder if they were as Servants, and our condition the ſtate of Sons in compariſon of theirs; though the almoſt viſibly convincing knowledg they had of God, and his placable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40303:120"/> and mercy, did prevail with them to perform the Goſpel-condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſincere ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God. Bleſſed be God that hath revealed thoſe things to us, that were hid comparatively from many wiſe, prudent, yea, and holy men! What helps have we, which they wanted, to turn to God! What helps to the love of God, and to all cheerful obedience! He ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully loving us firſt, even while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly; as we may clearly and with open face, comparatively to them, now ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>God commendeth his love to us, in that while we were ſinners, and enemies, and ungodly, Chriſt died for us.</hi> And if ſo, much more now when we are converted, and ſo juſtified by his blood, we may eaſily believe, We ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him; for, then we have a Right by Promiſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. For, if when we were enemies, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in oppoſition to Heaven; and ſo he, as Rector, an Enemy to us: if then he found a ranſome, and we were then reconciled to God in the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40303:120"/> death of his Son, <hi>quoad meritum,</hi> ſo far as concerns the price, and the conditional pardon made out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; much more being actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, as we are upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Goſpel-condition, we ſhall be ſaved by his living to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for us, and to ſee we have the fruit of his Death, and our Faith, the ſalvation of our ſouls, <hi>v.</hi> 11. And not only ſo, but when thus convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>we joy in God, as having now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the atonement.</hi> There was an atonement in his death before; but now we have intereſt in it, having performed the Goſpel-condition, we are actually, and not only, <hi>quoad me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum,</hi> juſtified by it. What madneſs is in our hearts, if we refuſe to hear Him that hath thus convincingly ſpoken to us from Heaven? <hi>O fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently held out crucified amongst you?</hi> He means, by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel: for, Chriſt was crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and not at <hi>Galatia.</hi> And
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40303:121"/> the ſame may by the ſame reaſon be urged on us. O fooliſh, yea more than fooliſh, even bewitched Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we, to do ſuch an unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, as to refuſe to obey the Goſpel; even we, before whoſe eyes Chriſt is evidently held forth cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. If we periſh, we may every one of us ſay with him in <hi>Terence, Et prudens, &amp; ſciens, vivus videnſ<expan>

               </p>
               <p>3. This informs us, That fallen man could never have fulfilled the Law, or ſatisfied Juſtice for the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40303:121"/> breach of it; elſe Chriſt needed not to have died for this end, That God might be juſt: for, God might then have been juſt, and the juſtifier of faln man, after their good deeds, and ſufferings, or ſatisfactions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt's death: whereas the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells, <hi>All are concluded under ſin;</hi> and, that therefore all that were or are juſtified, were, are, and ſhall be juſtified, were, are, and ſhall be juſtified only this way, by the pardon of ſin through this Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon their Faith, Repentance, and new Obedience. To account our Reformations, Humiliations, Faith, Obedience, in the place of a Satisfaction, Expiation, for our evil deeds, is to pervert the deſign of the whole Goſpel. <hi>Chriſt is become of</hi>

               <p>How contradictory to this whole Doctrine is the avowed Popiſh Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of Merits! Though ſome of their deluded ones amongſt us are kept ſo ignorant of their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as to tell us, Their Church holdeth no ſuch thing, as the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40303:122"/> eternal life by their works. I know they are all to pieces about this, as well as about other things they hold it Hereſie to deny. But did theſe never hear or read them diſcourſing of their works of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-erogation; that they can, not only merit, but ſo over-merit, as to ſupererogate, and have much to ſpare for thoſe that need Merits? Many of them, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth, ſpeak at a higher rate for Merit than he himſelf; and yet this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate man is too high of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. <hi>Jam verò opera bona juſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>

Yet he allows the Merit of good works to be aſcribed not only to the Dignity of the Perſons of good men, and worthineſs of the works themſelves, but alſo to God's promiſe and acceptation; though it be a contradiction: for if of meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious works, then not of grace; and if of grace, then not of meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious works; elſe grace is not grace, and merit is not merit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6.

               <p>How far is the performance of the Goſpel-condition from meriting the things promiſed, when Chriſt dyed for this end, That God might juſtifie and ſave them that perform it? <hi>There is no other Name given under Heaven whereby we can be ſaved.</hi> Neither Saints nor Angels could by any means redeem us, or give to God a ranſome for us: for then, Chriſt
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40303:123"/> dyed ſtill in vain; for it is in vain for that to be done with greater coſt which may be done with leſs. Could we once ſee all our righteouſneſs to be as filthy rags; could we cry out in ſenſe of our unworthineſs, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhould we come before him?</hi> Then we might with great delight hear Chriſt ſayiug, <hi>Come unto me, take up my yoke, and you ſhall find reſt for your ſouls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. They much wrong God and Chriſt, that think, Chriſt dyed to procure liberty to ſin, or to free men from duty, from obedience to the Law. He dyed to free men from the curſe of the Law, but not from obedience to it; but from the curſe, on condition of their ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Chriſt hath indeed procured pardon for our ſins and imperfect obedience; but enjoins us, under the greateſt forfeiture, a ſincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of univerſal obedience. Some have ſaid, Do but believe you ſhall be ſaved, and you ſhall be ſaved; do but keep up a good conceit of your ſafety, a ſtrong faith (as they call it)
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40303:124"/> you are ſafe. Others, Do but rely, and you are juſtified, and ſhall be ſaved. This reliance on Chriſt for juſtification and ſalvation, is a great duty, but a ſecondary one. None ſhould truſt in God, or ſtay himſelf on him for ſalvation, but ſuch as firſt have the main of the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condition; <hi>ſuch as fear the Lord, and obey the voice of his Prophets,</hi> Iſa. 50. 10. It would be a Miniſter's ſin to bid people rely on Chriſt for ſalvation, that are going on reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly in their ſins; for ſuch ſhould be ſo far from relying on him to ſave them, that they ought to believe He will not ſave ſuch as they; and it is to diſhonour Chriſt to think he will. But they are to bid them conſent to the Goſpel-terms, perform the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-condition, and ſo rely. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is a very inconvenient word to expreſs the condition of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by, becauſe it is ſeparable from juſtification: for a man may rely, and yet periſh, <hi>Mich.</hi> 3. 11. And one may be in a juſtified eſtate, having the true Goſpel-condition of heart-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:40303:124"/> and yet think God will not ſave him, through ſome miſapprehenſions: And ſurely, they do not rely and truſt on him to ſave them while they judg he will not, though they know none elſe can ſave them. But hearty-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Goſpel-terms, is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from juſtification: for, a man cannot be or continue in a juſtified eſtate, without hearty willingneſs to obey the Goſpel. Miniſters are to bid the greateſt reſolved ſinners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, while they take belief in the Scripture-Goſpel-ſenſe, for conſent to the Goſpel-terms, for accepting Chriſt for their Lord and Saviour, for believing the Goſpel, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying ſuitably to ſuch a belief; but not in that ſenſe that many uſe the words <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Believing.</hi> Chriſt, you ſee, dyed not that thoſe might be juſtified that refuſe finally to give ſincere obedience to the Law, and ſo obedience to the Goſpel; but that he might be a juſtifier of him that is of the Faith of Chriſt, of the Chriſtian Faith, a Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:40303:125"/>
               <p>5. We may learn hence, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely miſchievous nature of ſin. What wickedneſs and malignity is there in it, when nothing but the blood of Chriſt could expiate it? And, oh the deep ſtain that ſin ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that nothing but ſuch preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood could waſh out! A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Diſeaſe ſure, that required ſuch a deſperate remedy! The evil of ſin ſhould be more ſeen by us in Chriſt's dying for it, than in milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being damned for it. If we could look into Hell, and ſee the torments there, they could not ſo fully ſhew us God's hatred of ſin, as Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified doth.</p>
               <p>Sin ſtriketh at the Being of God, ſtriveth with all its might that God might not be; it is enmity againſt God. In every act of deliberate ſin we make a ſcoff at God's Holineſs, contemn his Juſtice; we ſlight his Counſel as fooliſhneſs; think we know better than he, what is good for our ſelves; or we think God a deceiver, one that envies our good, and counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us for our hurt; we ſtrike at
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40303:125"/> his Rule and Dominion. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if God be an enemy to ſin, and ſet himſelf againſt it to purpoſe. No wonder, if God with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and much ado, hath returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to favour with ſinners. What fools are they that make a mock of ſin, a ſport at ſin, at a high affront of the High and Holy Majeſty of Heaven and Earth! Will you laugh at that which was ſuch a weight on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Mighty God, and Prince of Peace, and muſt be a bitter weight to thee in Repentance, ere thou get eaſement? Oh the blindneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs of the ſecure World! What a leight matter do they make of ſin! Make but little matter of outward groſs ſins; and look upon inward ſins, as Pride, Malice, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, as no ſins. How eaſily they think God might pardon, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God ſhould make ſo much ado, think his thoughts ſhould be like theirs, and he ſhould hate it no more than they. How far are their thoughts from his thoughts!</p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:40303:126"/>
               <p>Oh you that have ſlight thoughts of ſin, as of a tame mild thing that hath no ſting, no great hurt in it; <hi>Let not my ſoul come into your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</hi> You do in your hearts blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme this great and ſtupendious tranſaction of Heaven, and that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy name of Chriſt wherewith you are called: You deſpiſe God in your hearts, and ſay as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Saul, After whom doth the King of Iſrael purſue? after a dead dog? after a flea?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the great King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould never be ſo vain, as to trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about ſuch an inconſiderable fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as I am. A dead dog cannot bite; a flea can bite, but a flea-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is a ſmall matter: you that think ſin but like a flea, and its hurt like a flea-biting, you do charge the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in your hearts fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly, as if he made all this ado in Chriſt's death about nothing; you in effect maintain, as if God did <hi>magno conatu magnas nugas agere,</hi> as if theſe things were but Childrens play; as if Chriſt dyed as a fool dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40303:126"/> to no purpoſe: for, if ſin be ſuch a ſlight matter, then Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain. How far are your thoughts from God's thoughts! You ſhall ſee it an evil and bitter thing, and of dreadful deſert; and admire at, inſtead of contemning this. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God manifeſted in this wiſe plot of the Trinity, for man's ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, before ever you come to have this great benefit of it.</p>
               <p>6. This ſpeaks dreadfully to all unbelieving, impenitent, Chriſt-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing ſinners: What will become of them that ſlight their Redeemer, that ſhall have no part in his blood, becauſe they tread it under foot? If Chriſt died for this end, becauſe elſe God could not with ſafety to his Juſtice pardon believing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, returning ſinners; what will become of them that believe not, repent not, return not? The death of Chriſt is to incorrigible ſinners the dreadfulleſt ſtory they can read; it ſetteth convincingly forth before their eyes, and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth out to their ears, the inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40303:127"/> Juſtice of God, and what a fearful thing it is to fall into the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended hands of the living God. It may make a man ſweat, may put a man into an agony, to tell of thoſe things that are by the ſufferings of Chriſt, proclaimed aloud to the World, to befall wilful contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this offer of Chriſt and Grace. <hi>If theſe things were done to the green tree, what ſhall be done to the dry?</hi> If he whoſe judgment was not to have drunk this Cup, hath drunk ſo deeply of it, <hi>Art thou he that ſhalt go unpuniſhed?</hi> Jer. 49. 12. <hi>How ſhall they eſcape that neglect ſo great ſalvation!</hi> You that ſay, you cannot believe God will be ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to impenitent ſinners, as the Scripture and your Miniſters tell you: See here dreadful Juſtice, and believe; ſee here how ſeverely God dealt with his only beloved Son, when he had undertaken to ſatisfie for our ſins, to be as it were our Subſtitute. If any ſhould now eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, ſurely he ſhould; he was but as a Surety. How little encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40303:127"/> haſt thou to think he will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence again with his threat, that haſt ſeen how hardly he hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed with it before? God hath once indeed accepted of a great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin; but if men now once finally refuſe him that thus ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from Heaven, <hi>There remains no more ſacrifice for ſin. If any man when he hears the words of this curſe</hi> (that fell on Chriſt, <hi>being made a Curſe for us) ſhall bleſs himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the way of my own heart,</hi> and not after the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Lord-Redeemer; ſurely <hi>the wrath of God ſhall ſmoak againſt that man, and God ſhall blot out his name from under heaven, and he ſhall bear his iniquity himſelf for ever and ever.</hi> What remaineth for ſuch, but <hi>a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation that ſhall devour ſuch adverſaries, ſuch enemies that would not have this man</hi> (the Lord Jeſus) <hi>to rule over them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. This ſpeaks comfort to true Believers, to repenting, returning
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40303:128"/> ſinners; notwithſtanding their great ſins they have been guilty of before converſion, and ſince converſion. God hath, you ſee, ſet forth Chriſt a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation. You need not fear, that you ſhould feel what he felt, ſuch expiatory Hell-ſorrows, or eternal and deſtructive puniſhments. Yours ſhall be common to men, common to Chriſtians; leight afflictions, and for a moment, and ſanctified and well rewarded. When your hearts ake, and conſciences accuſe, and the Law, and Juſtice, and Holineſs of God, ſeem to urge for Satisfaction, look here at Chriſt made a Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. Do not ſay, It is we that have ſinned, and we muſt ſuffer; the ſins were committed by us, and muſt lye on us for ever. What did God lay the puniſhment of our ſins on Chriſt for? It would have been thus if Chriſt had not dyed; if it muſt yet be thus, Chriſt dyed in vain. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather is riſen again, who is
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40303:128"/> at the right hand of God, who alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth interceſſion for us:</hi> who will make it his buſineſs to ſee you have the fruit of his death. <hi>God is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with you, through him that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, and gave himſelf an offering and ſatisfaction to God for a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmelling ſavour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou art often, it may be, ſaying within thy ſelf, I want Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>The righteous Lord loveth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</hi> Heaven is a place only of righteous ones: How can ſuch an unworthy Creature ſtand before him without righteouſneſs? If I had not ſinned, or not ſo hainouſly ſinned, how well it would have been with me? O happy Angels and Saints in glory, they have righteouſneſs! Why, notwithſtanding our unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, yet in the Lord Chriſt we have righteouſneſs, <hi>whereby we are made acceptable in the Beloved.</hi> So that now Juſtice it ſelf is become your friend. Now becauſe God is juſt, the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent true Believer is and muſt be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. <hi>Now God is faithful and juſt, to forgive you your ſins;</hi> it would
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40303:129"/> not be juſtice and faithfulneſs to do otherwiſe, when he hath made this Righteouſneſs over to the World by this Law of Grace, this ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and you have the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>You that are ſenſible of the great wrong you have done the Lord, here you may comfortably ſee it made up and ſatisfied for. Lord, thou art well paid; thou haſt greater Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in ſaving than in damning me: in damning me, thou haſt only my blood for Satisfaction; but in ſaving me, the blood of Chriſt. God hath been diſhonoured by you; but look here, and ſee Chriſt giving him as much honour as you deprived him of.</p>
               <p>The price is paid, yea, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God; and he hath declared his Satisfaction therewith, and made a Law of Grace upon it, and cannot go back; and now ſaith, <hi>Fury is not in me.</hi> This ſhould be health to our bones, and wine to our hearts. And that which hath ſatisfied God for the ſins of Thouſands now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:40303:129"/> may well ſerve to ſatisfie the Conſcience of any yielding, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, turning ſinner upon earth. Here is a Pillow to lay heads and hearts on; here is ſtability and certainty; here is ſomething for the ſole of the foot of our ſouls to reſt on. You may come boldly to the Throne of Grace, having ſuch a High-Prieſt. You may ſit under Chriſt's ſhadow with great delight, ſhaded from the heat of God's diſpleaſure. He was ſcorched with God's wrath, that we might be cooled, ſhaded, comforted, by that ſhadow that he hath made for wearied ſouls, by being hanged on a Tree. All other ſhadows are ſhadows fleeing away. Worldly comforts and ſhadows are like Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſes, the more they ſhadow us, the more they ſcorch us, for the moſt part. There is a Worm in all other Gourds; they dye, but our Redeemer liveth; <hi>and becauſe I live, you ſhall live alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. This ſpeaketh, comfort may I call it? that ſeems too high a word; and therefore I will rather ſay, It
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:40303:130"/> ſpeaks encouragement to ſinners thinking upon a return, and to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to return. Here is a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to come, <hi>Return and live.</hi> There is no greater hinderance to motion, than want of hope; [no man hath hired us]; we have no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges offered us. <hi>Judah</hi> was called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to return; but ſhe anſwered, <hi>No, for there is no hope; for I have loved ſtrangers, and after them I will go,</hi> Jer. 2. 25. It is as good, we uſe to ſay, to ſit idle, as work idle. How little encouragement would there have been for Prayers, Tears, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Reformation, if Chriſt had not dyed? <hi>Eſau</hi> (we read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17.) <hi>found no place of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, though he ſought it carefully with tears.</hi> The meaning is (as you may plainly ſee by peruſing the places) though he ſought it with tears, that his Father <hi>Iſaac</hi> would repent and change his mind, and call back the bleſſing from <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and give it to him; yet he found no place for his Father's repentance, for change of his Father's mind,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40303:130"/> though he wept, and ſaid, <hi>Bleſs me, O my Father.</hi> So, if Chriſt had not dyed, you would have found no place for God's repentance, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his ſentence, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written,</hi> &amp;c. Though you had ſought it carefully with tears, He would have ſaid, <hi>What I have written, I have written.</hi> It would have been uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable praying, when we muſt in effect ſay, Lord diſhonour thy ſelf for our ſakes: Uncomfortable ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ask for that which God in Juſtice and Honour cannot grant; when God may anſwer, <hi>Even ask the Kingdom alſo:</hi> Ask as well that I be not God, as that I be not juſt. But now though God may have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in my deſtruction (the glory of his Juſtice); yet he may have greater glory in my ſalvation, even the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this ſtupendious Juſtice and Mercy? Now there may be glory to God on high, and yet peace on earth, and good-will towards ſinful man.</p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:40303:131"/>
               <p>Here is yet hope for the greateſt ſinners: It is now no blemiſh to God's Honour to ſave the greateſt Offenders. He deſigned great things in giving Chriſt; there is <hi>plenteous redemption. He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt them that come to God by him. The blood of Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin.</hi> No ſpot or ſtain is of ſo deep a dye, that the blood of Chriſt cannot waſh it out: No Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſo deſperate, that he cannot cure it: No Debt ſo great as to be unſatisfied for. Aggravate thy ſin to the higheſt, and ſpare not; this Red Sea of Chriſt's blood is large enough, deep enough to drown the tall <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hoſt of thy ſins.</p>
               <p>If one man by his ſin was able to deſtroy a World, ſurely God by his Sufferings is able to ſave the World, would the whole World run after him, as the <hi>Jews</hi> once enviouſly ſpake. So long as thou art one of the World, and thy particular ſins are not ſo great as the ſins of the whole World, thou haſt encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come; <hi>They that come to him,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:40303:131"/> he will in no wiſe caſt off,</hi> as if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his power to cure and heal. <hi>Come unto me all you that labour, and are heavy-laden; take up my yoke, and I will eaſe you.</hi> He ſaith not, I will do it if I can; it is a provocation to make ſuch a ſuppoſition: to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair here, is to make Chriſt as no Chriſt. <hi>Whoſoever will, let him come.</hi> None ſhall ever be able to lift up their heads ſo high againſt God hereafter, as to ſay, Lord I would, and thou wouldſt not; I would have had thee on thy own terms at laſt, though I long rejected thee, and thou wouldſt not help me, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and accept me upon this my hearty willingneſs. No, God will be able to ſay of thoſe that periſh, I would, and you would not. Nothing but final wilful refuſal of Chriſt and his Government, ſhall undo you. It was a convincing ſign of recovery from ſickneſs, to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that the Sun went back. Are we ſick, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, even to death? Let this be a convincing ſign of hope to us, Our Sun, the Sun of Righteouſneſs hath
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:40303:132"/> gone back many degrees. Let this perſwade thee, he will not deceive thee; if he would, he could have done it at an eaſier rate than the blood of his Son. God is willing; waſt thou but willing, all is done. It is certain there cannot be any other hinderance. How willing was God to ſave thee, that ſent Chriſt to dye for thee? and ſure Chriſt valued thy Soul much, or he would not have given ſuch a Price.</p>

               <p>1. STudy this Truth, this Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt's death more. The Angels themſelves deſire to look into it; they are Students in this piece of Divinity, though it little concern them in compariſon of us. <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid of Philoſophy, That it was nothing elſe but a meditating on death. We may with more ſhew ſay of Chriſtianity, Chriſtian Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; It is nothing elſe but <hi>meditatio mortis Chriſti,</hi> the Meditation on Chriſt's death. How unworthy are they of the name of Chriſtians, that neglect this ſtudy? that had rather hear or read any Moral Diſcourſe of commendable Heathens, than the Goſpel of Chriſt? When <hi>Auſtin</hi> could take little delight in <hi>Tully</hi>'s Works (though worthy ones in their kind) becauſe the Name <hi>[Jeſus]</hi> was not found there: Yet ſome look
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40303:133"/> on Chriſtianity, and the ſtudy of Chriſt, as below them.</p>
               <p>How unworthy of that worthy Name, wherewith yet they would be called, are that ſort of people riſen up in our days, that call our Chriſt a carnal Chriſt? that call this Chriſt without us, that dyed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> roſe again, and ſits in Heaven, A carnal Chriſt? They are all for a Chriſt within us, a Spiritual Chriſt (as they ſpeak), and that in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to a Chriſt without us. What do they mean by a Chriſt within us? a work of Grace on the heart? Let us grant they take it in ſuch a ſober ſenſe: This is indeed the condition of our intereſt in Chriſt without us; but this is not the Atonement, the Propitiation that the Angels deſire to look into: For, this Holineſs they have in a more glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than our Chriſt within us, our imperfect holineſs, can preſent to their view. This was not that Chriſt crucified that the Apoſtle did ſo prize the knowledg of. And this work of Grace could never have been within
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40303:133"/> us, had it not been for a Chriſt without us; and had it been within us, yet it would never have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable to Salvation or Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but for the Chriſt without us. There is no blood, no ſatisfaction in this Chriſt within us; nothing but what would have been eſteemed by God, and is, in reality, as menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rags, in reſpect of attaining Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification without this work of Chriſt without us upon the Croſs. And yet theſe would make, Grace ſhould I ſay? I rather ſay, Morality and Civility; yea, to ſpeak truly of ſome of them, Incivility and Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, their righteouſneſs; though it be a Goſpel-command to be courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Theſe delight ſo little in our Chriſt without us, that it is with much difficulty that they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſt come and crucified in the fleſh, if indeed they will confeſs it: for-ſome ſhrink at ſuch a queſtion, and would fain put it off. And I dare ſay, That any of you that ever heard them talk, can bear witneſs, that they ſpeak not as men delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:40303:134"/> in, or making any account of this Propitiation, Ranſom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Curſed are they that love not our Lord Jeſus. Theſe honour not God. The honour that cometh to God by works of Creation and Providence, is counted as no honour in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the honour that comes to him by this Redemption; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father.</hi> God accounteth all honour as no honour in compariſon of this; Hence we read <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto him be glory in the Church, by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Phil. 1. 11. <hi>Being filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt unto the glory and praiſe of God.</hi> And, <hi>Spiritual ſacrifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And in Heaven the loudeſt and higheſt praiſes will be upon this account, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb to receive honour,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Theſe ſeeking to eſtabliſh their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, make void the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> through their ignorance of the righteouſneſs of God. Wonderful! that ever the Devil ſhould ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:40303:134"/> people! that ever the God of this world ſhould ſo far blind men's eyes! that ever he ſhould ſo prevail with this device to work Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity out of men's hearts, ſo as to make them renounce the Chriſtian Religion, under pretence of high Chriſtianity! to look on Chriſt as a carnal Chriſt, or the blood of Chriſt as a common or unholy thing; on our Redeemer (whom all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians venerate and adore) as a low nothing; and to call his faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Lyers and Deceivers.</p>
               <p>But ſtudy you theſe things, that you may admire Chriſt; for he is, and is to be admired in, and of all his people. Here is not ſuch obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as to diſcourage your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs; nor ſuch facility as to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion your contempt. You may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſee enough to admire all your days, and yet ſtill you are to learn. It may be ſaid to them of the higheſt form, <hi>Go and learn what it means,</hi> what Chriſt crucified means. Here is a riddle of Mercy, a riddle of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, a riddle of Juſtice. Chriſt is
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:40303:135"/> called <hi>[Wonderful];</hi> He is ſo in his Natures, Offices, Death. Let theſe things be much in your mind. It is like his complaint, <hi>Diem perdidi,</hi> I have loſt a day; to have cauſe to ſay, I have lived another day, and have not had a ſerious thought of Chriſt and his Death. <hi>Do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me. Look upon him whom we have pierced. Study the reaſons and ends of his ſorrows and ſufferings.</hi> He dyed not as a fool dieth; it was for ſome great End, and this end muſt not be fruſtrated. Wo to us if it be as to us! This knowledg would be better to us than our daily bread; this ſtudy is more neceſſary than our appointed food. Is there but one Medicine in the World to heal us, and will you not learn it, ſtudy it, and the uſe and virtue of it, and how to apply it by Meditation. that it may have its diverſity of effects upon us? St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to <hi>know nothing but Chriſt and him crucified.</hi> And <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s laſt words of Exhortation in his laſt Epiſtle are, <hi>Grow in grace,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40303:135"/> and in the knowledg of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> And acting our faith and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of theſe things, by Meditation, would be hugely influential to work and encreaſe Grace. Come to other knowledg, and he that encreaſeth knowledg, encreaſeth grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: but he that encreaſeth in this knowledg, and is ſuitably affected with it, layeth a foundation for perfect peace, quietneſs, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for ever.</p>
               <p>Let Miniſters ſtudy this more, and ſo preach this more. <hi>I deſire to know nothing among you</hi> (that is, to know ſo as to preach nothing among you) <hi>ſave Chriſt and him crucified.</hi> Preach not your ſelves, but Chriſt. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe much plainneſs of ſpeech.</hi> Preach not like <hi>Moſes,</hi> with a vail on your face. Let not people live and dye in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſt, if you can help it: Diſcover all to ſinners. Let them ſee the Lord their Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Now in ſtudying and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe things: Admire!</p>
               <p n="1">1. Admire the Juſtice of God.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40303:136"/> Never was ſuch Juſtice heard of ſince the world began; Juſtice in a Myſtery; He ſpared not his Son, that he might ſpare Sinners. He hardned his heart againſt the cry of his Son, that he might opeu his heart to the cry of Sinners. Behold how he not only loved us, but hated ſin! The dreadful inſtances of man caſt out of Paradiſe, the drowning of the World, the deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> the reſervation of the faln Angels in horror and darkneſs, are fearful Monuments of God's hatred of ſin.</p>
               <p>But here Juſtice and Holineſs ſhine as the Sun in the Firmament. When his beloved Son ſtood in the place and ſtead of Sinners, he muſt dye ſuch a ſhameful, painful, accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed death. Surely had there been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpect of perſons with God, could Juſtice have been perverted and drawn aſide with any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his only beloved Son ſhould have eſcaped. Here is inexorable Juſtice! inflexible Juſtice! This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his Righteouſneſs indeed, that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:40303:136"/> he would not ſpare Sin, but puniſh it, though on his innocent Son. Here is infinite Juſtice, fear it, dread it. Make this God thy fear and thy dread.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Admire the love of the Father and the Son. The Father: Bleſs God for this Propitiation. How dreadful was our condition! How if Juſtice had taken thee by the throat, and ſaid, Pay me what thou oweſt? thou couldſt not have reply'd, Have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience with me, and I will pay thee all. God lays great engagements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, in cauſing his Sun to ſhine, in giving rain and fruitful ſeaſons, in making proviſion for our bodies; but that which ſhould endear him moſt to the world, and ſhould occaſion our higheſt praiſes, ſhould be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding a Righteouſneſs for our ſouls. Oh that the Lord ſhould look upon ſuch dead dogs as we are. <hi>What is man that thou art mindful of him; and the ſon of man, that thou ſhouldſt viſit him!</hi> That thou ſhouldſt give him ſuch a Phyſician as thy Son, to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40303:137"/> cure him with his blood! <hi>What is man that thou ſhouldſt magnifie, and ſet thy heart upon him!</hi> Admire and wonder at the love of the Son; that Chriſt, the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> ſhould be willing to dye for ſuch dead dogs! That God's fellow ſhould be willing to be ſmitten and wounded, that by his ſtripes we might be healed! that he ſhould give Himſelf, his Blood, and Soul, a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for Traytors, for Enemies! That he ſhould intercede, as <hi>Moſes, Blot me, I pray thee, out of the book of life;</hi> and ſay as <hi>Paul, Let me rather be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed!</hi> That he ſhould ſay to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, If they have wronged thee, put it on mine account, I will pay it; written, not with my hand, but with my blood! That he ſhould ſay with <hi>Rebeccah, On me be thy curſe, my Son!</hi> That Chriſt ſhould go into the fire, that we may be as brands pluckt out of the fire! That the moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhould be willing to be curſed, that we curſed ones might be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed! That ſuch a Tree of life, ſuch a fruit-bearing Tree, ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40303:137"/> to be cut down and dye, to ſave Trees of death, dead, dry, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Trees, cumbring the ground. It is commonly ſaid of men undone by Suretiſhip, <hi>Their own kind hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did them:</hi> We may ſay of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, His own kind heart laid him thus low, brought theſe cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities upon him. How dear ſhould he be to us! <hi>Quanto pro me vilior tanto mihi charior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Labour to know the love of God and Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledg, that you may be able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend with all Saints, the heighth, length, depth, and breadth of it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 18, 19. Had we hearts as full of love as they could hold, yea, as full as all the hearts of Men and Angels could hold, we could not love him as he deſerves from us. We had need, with the Widow, to beg and borrow Veſſels to fill; our hearts cannot hold enough. Were we not cold frozen pieces of earth, the fire would burn while we are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. This love of God and Chriſt would ſet our hearts on fire.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:40303:138"/>3. Admire the Wiſdom of God in this great Tranſaction! This was matter of reproach amongſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, their grand Objection againſt Chriſtianity, <hi>Deus veſter Patibulo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixus eſt:</hi> Your God was crucified: and, <hi>Chriſt crucified was to the Jews a ſtumbling-block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs.</hi> But it is <hi>wiſdom to them that are perfect;</hi> and to them that are ſaved by Chriſt, <hi>Chriſt is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and the power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 8, 24, 25. Never was ſuch a ſtrain of Wiſdom heard of as this, ſince the World began. O the wiſe plot and contrivance of the Trinity, for the ſalvation of loſt man! here are Treaſures of Wiſdom; unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble riches of Wiſdom; Wiſdom in a myſtery, to find out a way for the greateſt Juſtice and Mercy to meet. Wiſdom bringing light to us out of Chriſt's darkneſs, life out of his death; making the fall of Chriſt the riſing of the World. Such Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as the Princes of this World knew not; ſuch Wiſdom as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40303:138"/> Devils could not fathom. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom confounding the Devils, and making them to help forward our ſalvation, by endeavouring our ruin in deſtroying Chriſt. He deſtroyed his own Kingdom, in ſeeking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Chriſt's Kingdom.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Exhort.</hi> Keep humble and low thoughts of your ſelves; yea, be aſhamed and confounded in your ſelves, becauſe of his kindneſs in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus pacified toward you. Look to the hole of the pit whence you were digged, and ſee what you were by nature, and what your lot and portion was. Look at your ſelves, at the beſt, but as Beggars in the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother's Clothes. Say of your Righteouſneſs, Alas, it was but bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed! Some are admiring their own virtuous lives, the innocent lives they have lived; theſe cannot but ſleight the Death and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt: This is a direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Grace of the Goſpel:
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:40303:139"/> and Publicans and Harlots will have benefit by this, before them that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie themſelves. What needed Chriſt to dye for thee, if thou be ſo good as thou wouldſt make thy ſelf? The deſign of the Goſpel is, That every mouth might be ſtopped in boaſting, and all fleſh be guilty in their own ſight before God. And this is one part of the condition of life and righteouſneſs through Chriſt, To be deeply ſenſible how juſt it would have been with God to have damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us. And the full ſoul, in this ſenſe, cannot but loathe this honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb. And theſe Truths would be ſweet unto us, were we pinched with want and hunger.</p>
               <p>3. Prize your Souls; ſet a high value on them, ſince God did ſo, Chriſt did ſo: They were ranſom'd at a high rate. You have heard ſometime of the ranſome of a King, as a huge matter; it is nothing to the ranſome of a Soul; this is precious indeed, Chriſt that well knew the worth of Souls, paying ſo dear for
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40303:139"/> them. Our ſouls <hi>were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold;</hi> do not ſell them away for ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and gold, for that which could not purchaſe them. We were not free-born; with a great ſum was this freedom, this reprieve and hopeful time of trial obtained; ſell them not away for trifles. Thirty and two years and upwards was this Temple in building, this Soul in redeeming, by Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God; loſe it not, ſell it not, for the ſinful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding pleaſures of a few days; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it not in three days.</p>
               <p>4. Look too, that this Blood be not loſt; this great Counſel of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven loſt as to us. <hi>Look to your ſelves, that we loſe not the things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward,</hi> 2 Joh. v. 8.</p>
               <p>It is ſad thing for a man to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, I have beaten the air, and ſpent my ſtrength in vain. Have you done and ſuffered ſo many things in vain, if it be yet in vain? But much more ſhould this prevail with us; Take heed that you loſe not the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40303:140"/> things that Chriſt hath wrought. A ſad thing for Miniſters to complain, We have ſpent our ſtrength in vain; but much more for Chriſt to ſay, I have loſt my labours, tears, wounds, death, as to theſe men.</p>
               <p>The Righteouſneſs, and Pardon, and Life, which he hath purchaſed, were not for Himſelf; he hath no more need of them, than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens have need of rain, or the Sun of light. Cut off, but not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: therefore, if you refuſe this offer, you endeavour interpretative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it may be ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>He died as a fool dieth.</hi> You ſay to Chriſt's face virtually, You might have been wiſer than to work and take pains for one that gives you ſo little thanks.</p>
               <p>Is this thy kindneſs to thy Friend? Is this thy thanks to thy Redeemer? Hath not Chriſt deſerved thee? If the Devil and Sin have, and will do more for thee, let them take thee: Say then, I love my Maſter Sin and Satan, and will not go out free. But ſtudy how thou wilt anſwer it to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40303:140"/> God, and look thy Redeemer in the face. Do you mock God, and your Redeemer? and ſay, You might have ſpared your ſelf, as <hi>Peter</hi> bade you? Who bade you thus love me? You might have let the loving me alone. God will not be mocked; <hi>Be you not mockers leſt your bonds be made ſtrong;</hi> And Chriſt will yet have ſome reward in well-doing, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in thy ruin; thy refuſal, and puniſhment for it.</p>
               <p>But theſe are ſecondary Ends, and Ends only upon ſuppoſition of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of his Grace. The primary End of his Death and Law of Grace, is your Salvation: for, he came not into the world primarily to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved. God ſweareth, he <hi>deſires not the death of the wicked, but rather that he would turn and live.</hi> The primary End of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel and Law of Grace, is your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Salvation; and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily, upon ſuppoſition of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, Condemnation. It cannot be ſaid of a Governour making a Law,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40303:141"/> It was weakly done of him when he foreſaw many would break it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he want Power or Juſtice to vindicate it. Dare you ſay, It was not wiſely done of God to make the firſt Covenant with Promiſe to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> becauſe he foreſaw he would loſe the benefit of it, and incur the curſe? And dare you ſay, It was no kindneſs? Suppoſe God had not known; Would that have made any change in the thing, by making the ſin greater, and God's kindneſs more? This is to ſay, God's Omniſcience hinders him from being Rector of the World, from being able to make gracious Promiſes to the obedient, and juſt Threatnings to the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. Take heed of ſuch Doctrines as would in their own nature cauſe you to have hard thoughts of God, and diſcourage your return to him; and conclude they are falſe, that are ſo expreſly contrary to the whole te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Goſpel: Though you know not how to anſwer the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, I dare confidently tell you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can, and have anſwered in the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40303:141"/> main ſuch difficulties ſatisfactorily, and that in a way well agreeing with ſpecial grace. And I could do it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily to you I think; and ſhould now, if I thought it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient to turn to an alien ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But ſuppoſe I could not, no nor the ableſt men, muſt we therefore deny plain Scripture-truths, becauſe men know but in part, and can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer many difficulties but imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? But to return: Shall Chriſt fall ſhort of the primary End of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of his ſoul? This is the reward and fruit Chriſt waits for, To ſee the travel of his ſoul; to ſee his ſeed, a generation of ſinners, turning and accepting his offered ſalvation; and then he will ſay, My blood was well ſhed indeed; I am well paid, well ſatisfied, ſo <hi>Iſrael</hi> be but thus gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and this he waits for, and ſtrives with thee about.</p>
               <p>Again, Is this thy kindneſs to thy own ſoul, Not to hearken to the cry of its neceſſity for a Saviour? It is in your power to reject the counſel of God againſt your ſelves, to your
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40303:142"/> hurt; it is in your power to fruſtrate all, and to make your ſelves of thoſe that ſhall have neither lot nor por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this matter. But if you pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, it is not long of Chriſt, but of your ſelves; you chuſe it. Would you be wiſe, you ſhould be wiſe for your ſelves: but, if you be ſcorners, you alone ſhall bear it. Once all was loſt, hopeleſs and helpleſs you were; but through this Propitiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is once more brought to your choice whether you will periſh or no. <hi>Why will you dye?</hi> If you will dye, who can help it? I cannot: I can only witneſs, I called, and you refuſed to come: And I hereby call you, <hi>Noverint univerſi, &amp;c. Be it known therefore unto you, Men and Brethren, That through this Man, and this Name, is preached to you the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins; and by him all that ſhall believe, all that ſhall receive him, ſhall be juſtified. And there is no other Name under Heaven given where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you can be juſtified and ſaved; and if you refuſe him, it is in vain to look for another.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:40303:142"/>
               <p>Are you willing to comply with this deſign of God for your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal welfare? Or muſt I ſay you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to come? Will you, or will you not, accept Chriſt for your Lord Redeemer, to ſanctifie and ſave you? If you will indeed, you ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſaved: If you will not, why will you not? What diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure have you taken againſt Chriſt? What blemiſh do you ſee in him? What is there that offends you in this wiſe ſtupendious diſpenſation of Chriſt crucified? What preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice have you entertained againſt this Counſel of God? What, do you think his terms too hard, ſo that all things conſidered, it would not be for your good? Then you think Chriſt <note place="margin">If any doubt of the truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Doctrine, let them, if they judg their ſouls worth ſo much pains, read thoſe learned Books lately written in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh on this Subject, and doubt if they can.</note> counſelleth you for your hurt: if ſo, you have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively worſe thoughts of Chriſt, than you ought to have of the Devil; for, you ought to think the Devil no worſe than he is: and if you think Chriſt
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:40303:143"/> calleth you for your hurt and loſs, and tells you what you ſhall never find true; you think Chriſt envies your good, and would deceive and cheat you, by perſwading you out of it; and what is this, but to think him worſe than the Devil? for the Devil, though he would deceive you, yet he never dyed and ſhed his blood to deceive you: but, if it be for your hurt to turn from ſin, and deny your ſelves, and take up his yoke, Chriſt hath dyed to undo you; which would be ſtrange maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! O the hainouſneſs of this ſin of refuſing Chriſt! It is virtually to eſteem him the horrid'ſt Impoſtor that ever the Sun ſaw.</p>
               <p>What a dreadful thing it is to ſtay a day or a night under the guilt of this refuſal of Chriſt! He that thus <hi>believeth not, is condemned already, and is yet under the curſe:</hi> and if he do but walk up and down the few more days, and ſleep out the few more nights of his life, he will be remedileſs: <hi>for there is no more ſacrifice for ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:40303:143"/>
               <p>But yet there is Balm in <hi>Gilead;</hi> there is a Phyſician there; why is not our health recovered? There are Treaſures in Chriſt; Treaſures of Righteouſneſs he would fain part with. Oh ſay, Theſe and theſe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Chriſt, deſpiſe his Riches; It may be thy Maſter (if thou be a ſervant) ſleights this great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable One's Treaſures, and will not receive at his hands the things which he hath bought and brought; but ſay thou, as <hi>Gehazi, As the Lord liveth, I will run after him, and take ſomething of him:</hi> and I can aſſure thee in his Name, whoſe Meſſenger I am, That he will be as ready to part with it to thee, as ever <hi>Naaman</hi> was to <hi>Gehazi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Have nothing to do with Sin. The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> would not tread on the threſhold they thought brake their Idol <hi>Dagon</hi>'s neck. The <hi>Jews</hi> would not put the Thirty pieces gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for betraying Chriſt, into the Treaſury, <hi>becauſe it was the price of blood,</hi> Mat. 27. 6. Will you look on
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:40303:144"/> ſin as gain? on that which you have gotten by ſin, as gain? It is the price of blood. Should that be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to thee which was ſo bitter to Chriſt? <hi>David</hi> would not drink of the water his Worthies had ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their lives for, but poured it out, and ſaid, <hi>Is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 17. Wilt thou put that Serpent into thy boſome, that hath ſtung to death thy deareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation? A ſtrange ſight for a Child to delight in that Sword or Knife that killed his Father. Some will break God's Law for the gain of two-pence. God made not ſuch a leight matter of the breach of his Law. Let this conſpicuous Juſtice of God be as a flaming-ſword to keep you from ſin. Since Chriſt hath dy'd for ſin, let us dye unto ſin; yea, let us rather chuſe to dye than to ſin.</p>

            <head>A Diſcourſe concerning the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning, by <hi>Juſtification by Faith,</hi> occaſioned by ſome paſſages in the Sermons.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Endeavour to make apparent, That the Apoſtle</hi> Paul, <hi>by</hi> Juſtification by works, <hi>and</hi> by the Law, <hi>means juſtification for mens deſerts and merits, or by unſinning obedience without pardon: And by</hi> Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Faith, <hi>means pardon of ſin upon mens believing and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſin to God: And that it is not in the leaſt his deſign to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Repentance and ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from being a condition of our juſtification; but that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes them in the word</hi> Faith.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>FIrſt, We are ſure, whatever the Apoſtle teacheth, is conſiſtent with himſelf and the whole tenour of Scripture: Therefore his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:40303:146"/> cannot be, That it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or that it is dangerous for any to repent and turn from ſin, for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or juſtification and ſalvation. But this I have already cleared.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We are ſure, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Apoſtle ſaith is true, and his arguing cogent; as when he tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>To him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt:</hi> and Rom. 11. 6. <hi>If by grace, then it is no more of works; but if it be of works, then it is no more of grace.</hi> Now this would not be true (for a reward may be of works, and yet of grace) unleſs by works he underſtand meritorious works, or full and compleat inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. If there be a promiſe made of a reward to a work, yet if the work be inconſiderable in value to the reward, this reward is to be aſcribed to the grace, and favour, and kindneſs, of him that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and giveth the reward, and not to the merit of his work that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it. It would be in this caſe, of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:40303:146"/> Grace as the Cauſe, though of Works as the Condition; the Works not being meritorious. Elſe it would be impoſſible for any promiſe to be a gracious promiſe, that hath any duty for the condition of it; which to affirm, would be the abhorring of any rational ſoul, yea though the condition was to be performed by the man's own ſtrength (whatever any ſay to the contrary), which yet is not in the caſe-in-hand, I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant; yea, a conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe would not be one jot leſs gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, if the condition was to be performed by man of himſelf; and is not more gracious, becauſe God cauſeth us to perform it; only this cauſing us to perform it, is more of grace. Dare any deliberately ſay, theſe conditional promiſes were not of grace, becauſe a work made the condition? viz. <hi>If the wicked turn, he ſhall live. Repent, that your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities may be blotted out.</hi> Nay, do we not expreſly read, Such are of grace? Jer. 3. 1, 12. <hi>Thou haſt playd
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:40303:147"/> the harlot with many lovers; yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall on you: For I am gracious and merciful.</hi> 2 Chron. 30 19. <hi>The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to ſeek,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>though he be not cleanſed according,</hi> &amp;c. Nehem. 13. 22. <hi>Remember me, my God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this alſo, and ſpare me accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the greatneſs of thy mercy. Jonah</hi> knew, if God ſpared <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh</hi> upon repentance, it would be an act of grace; <hi>I know thou art a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, and merciful,</hi> Jonah 4. 2. Whatſoever any one gives or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to another who works, more than the merit of the work amounts to, is of grace; and the juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any man upon any terms leſs than the obedience of the Law in every thing, is of Goſpel-grace, to wit, of pardon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The oppoſition of the Apoſtle is good and true, if by works be meant meritorious works, deſerving the reward, or full and compleat obedienee to the Law in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:40303:147"/> every thing, <hi>viz. If of</hi> meritorious <hi>works, then not of grace;</hi> then the reward is no more than what is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſtrict Juſtice; and one need not cry <hi>gratias,</hi> grace, grace; need not give thanks for ſuch a reward. And, if of compleat unſinning obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; one needs not pardon, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pardoned, cannot give thanks for the reward, as having of it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of ſin, pardoned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But would not <hi>Adam</hi>'s ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification have been of grace, if he had continued in his innocency, though it would have been of works?</p>
            <p>This ſome object againſt this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, That the Apoſtle meant it of meritorious works, or full obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and I never ſaw this well cleared, and many are much puzled with it; therefore I will ſpeak the more largely to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I diſtinguiſh here between juſtification ſimply taken, as juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:40303:148"/> of an innocent man accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or accuſable, though falſly; and between the juſtification of a man with the reſultancies from it; which, though immediate reſultan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, yet come on him upon his meer juſtification, by virtue of ſome gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Law, Promiſe, or Covenant, made on condition of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Suppoſe there had been no promiſe made of everlaſting happineſs to <hi>Adam,</hi> on condition of continued innocency; but only a threatning, That if he ſinned, he ſhould dye, be damned. Firſt, In this caſe while he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued innocent, it would have been of debt, not to have condemned him as a ſinner; and ſo juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him from any thing befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him for the breach of the Law, would have been of debt, and not of grace; no thanks. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, But his juſtification in this caſe would have reached but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:40303:148"/> way, would have reſulted no further than I have expreſſed: For God might yet when he pleaſed, have annihilated him; for it ſeems not rational to affirm, That if God make a rational Creature, he may not lawfully and in equity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make and annihilate it, except it offend him: this would be to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hard terms on God. But yet it would be of due debt, that this annihilation ſhould not be as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his diſpleaſure, and for the breach of the Law, if he had not broken it, as is ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Suppoſe the Covenant ran thus: If he obey, he ſhall live eternally happy; but if he ſin, he ſhall dye, be damned; as it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it did.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Here, while man keeps his innocency, That he be juſtified as innocent, and not condemned as guilty; is of natural equity, and not of grace. Which would have
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:40303:149"/> been enough, had we no more to ſay, to juſtifie the Apoſtle's ſpeech, if we take it not ſtrictly, but as we uſe to do other moral ſayings; the foundational and moſt immediately obvious part of juſtification, being of debt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But that this very ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification ſhould reach ſo far as right to continued life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would be of grace; becauſe that promiſe that cauſes this right to reſult, during him innocent, was of grace, and not of debt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Yet this juſtification thus reſulting to continued life and happineſs, would not (man conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing obedient) have been of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-grace, of that kind of grace which the Apoſtle hath occaſion mainly to ſpeak of, which is Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Pardon; it would not have been of Goſpel-grace, of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which is the thing the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath much in his eye. No thanks would be due upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of forgiving him any thing.</p>
            <pb n="297" facs="tcp:40303:149"/>
            <p>Fourthly, But to clear all beyond poſſibility of exception; The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle only ſpeaks <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> and on ſuppoſition: for the Creature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly merit any thing of God (but as above-ſaid, that, if innocent, he be not condemned as guilty) and the Apoſtle knew, their works were not meritorious, that his oppoſers pretended were ſo. Now ſuppoſe, I ſay, that obedience was meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of eternal life, of the reward; ſuppoſe, man did any thing merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of Heaven; then <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> ſalvation would not be of grace in any ſenſe, but properly of debt, which is all the Apoſtle here affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And it ſeems the Pharaiſaical Jews went as high (as ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts do now) as to hold their good works meritorious of eternal life; and our Jewiſh Antiquaries mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that this Tenent was common amongſt them; and you ſee, if of meritorious works, then not of grace in any ſenſe. And in this ſenſe <hi>Adam</hi>'s juſtification to life upon his
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:40303:150"/> unſinning obedience, would not have been of meritorious works, but of grace, though not of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Goſpel-grace and Mercy. It is eaſie to anſwer, take it which way you will. For if you will by <hi>works</hi> underſtand no more than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to the Law, then ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification will not be of Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, which is pardon. But if by <hi>works</hi> you will underſtand works properly meritorious of ſalvation; then if of works, not of grace at all. And in ſome places the Apoſtle ſeems to take the words in one ſenſe, ſometimes in the other. For, as here he ſeemeth to mean proper merit; ſo, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>As many as are of the works of the Law, are under a curſe; for it is written, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is every one that continueth not, &amp;c.</hi> implieth, Man ſhould have been bleſſed and not curſed, as being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by works, had he fulfilled, &amp;c. Here juſtification would have been of works not properly meritorious, but being of Law-works, it would
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:40303:150"/> not be by Goſpel-grace and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; though there would have been in ſuch a caſe the Law-grace ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. For (to ſpeak by way of anticipation) if God was not bound in ſtrict Juſtice to make ſuch a promiſe, <hi>If man obey perfectly, he ſhall be happy;</hi> if the making of it was of grace, the making of it doth not hinder the performance of it from being of grace, law-grace; no more than God's making this law, <hi>That ſinner that repents and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> maketh man's juſtification for being of Pardon and Goſpel-grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The Jews Works and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges were not meritorious nor perfect: Therefore the Apoſtle doth not mean by <hi>works,</hi> meritorious works, or perfect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, It is true, they were not meritorious, elſe they would have been juſtified and ſaved of debt, without Chriſt's ſatisfaction.</p>
            <pb n="300" facs="tcp:40303:151"/>
            <p>Secondly, But they maintained and pretended their works ſuch, and this was to make Chriſt's death vain. This very opinion made them ſlight Chriſt, and kept them from ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the righteouſneſs of God, the Goſpel-way of juſtification. And (by the way) if any ſhould now have this conceit concerning faith, repentance, ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, works of charity, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are meritorious of their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſalvation, a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their ſins, recompence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Juſtice; they would be in the ſame condemnation with theſe, and Chriſt ſhould profit them nothing. For, this was the reaſon why Circumciſion and other obſervations of the Law would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do them <hi>(Gal.</hi> 5. 2.), not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had that merit in them which they ſuppoſed; for then they would have been juſtified and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them: but becauſe they conceited them meritorious, making them worthy deſerving men; and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:40303:151"/> ſo could not poſſibly, during this conceit, expect or deſire juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in God's way of grace or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy through a Propitiation; they could not but deſpiſe it, as eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had no need of it, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they had not, if their conceit was true.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Faith and Repentance are works (it would move a man with pity to ſee the weakneſs of mens attempts to prove that faith is not a work, when Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf calls it a work) therefore his deſign is not to exclude every good work from any intereſt in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; elſe he would exclude Faith it ſelf; but only perfect or meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious works, or works conceited ſo to be, which comes all to one: for as works really compleat or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, would eſſentially hinder pardon by Chriſt's death, being eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially inconſiſtent: ſo a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiting his works meritorious, is by God's Law of Grace excluded from
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40303:152"/> any intereſt in this Propitiation. For he hath made it a part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, That men be ſenſible of their unworthineſs, unrighteouſneſs, and undone eſtate without Chriſt and Pardon. You ſee what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's meaning is not. Now that you may ſee what his meaning is, let theſe two things be well conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> What the Jews Opinions were; and, What the Apoſtle's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What the Jews Opinions were which <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſed; which are ſomething plain from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are made more plain by the Writings of ancient Jewiſh Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They held their good works meritorious of eternal life: yea, ſome of them maintained, that any one Commandment kept by a Jew, thus merited.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They had high thoughts of their great worth, as being <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s ſeed, and circumciſed worthy
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:40303:152"/> men: <hi>Think not to ſay, We have A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham to our Father.</hi> They were great boaſters; <hi>Where is boaſting then?</hi> Many of them held, all Jews (with very little exception) ſhould inherit eternal life; yea, though dying by the hand of Juſtice for crimes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Yet the more Phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſort talkt of repentance as a thing of little uſe to them that were of ſtrict obſervance to make up what wanted: The <hi>righteous perſon need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no repentance,</hi> ſeemeth to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken alluding to their opinion. The common people that knew not the Law, that knew not or uſed not their Traditions, were looked on by them as curſed, hopeleſs; no juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for ſuch, nothing would ſerve to ſave them, but taking up their way. <hi>John</hi>'s Doctrine of remiſſion of ſin, and juſtification upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and leading a new life, without Phariſaical, ſtrict, unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obſervances and traditions, which were not poſſible to be kept by peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:40303:153"/> of ordinary employment, was almoſt new doctrine amongſt them, and was derided by the Phariſees, as much as ſuch doctrine would be by the ſtrict and religious Orders (as they are called) amongſt the Papiſts; but was embraced as wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come news to the common people; for ſalvation to be a thing of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible attainment, by ordinary peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſenſible of their guilt; yea, and by Publicans and Soldiers, without leaving their courſe of life, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they carry regularly in it; and by Harlots, upon leaving their leud courſes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They held the Law required no more than the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the outward man.</p>
            <p>It was a determined caſe amongſt their <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>David Kimchi in Pſal. 66. v. 18. Aben Ezra in Dialog. Joſephus lib 12. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. Ju-Judaic. cap.</hi> 13.</note> Doctors before, and about theſe days, That evil thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires were not ſin; and that the Tenth Commandment was not a Command, but a Counſel, which men would do well to obſerve; but ſinned not in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting the obſervance of it. They
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:40303:153"/> had determined that, unleſs in the caſe of worſhipping falſe Gods, no ſin could be committed by the will, without an actual commiſſion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; and ſo, that it was no ſin to deſire to adulterate a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Wife, ſo the act followed not. And then, no wonder if many of them ſuppoſed themſelves to need no pardon or Goſpel-favour from God; no wonder, if the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees be repreſented as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to confeſs, never asking for pardon, never ſaying, <hi>God be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me a ſinner!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, They placed the moſt of their confidence in Ceremonial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>tything mint,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>neglected the weightier matters of the law,</hi> faith, repentance; placed much in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of unſcriptural-Traditions, to make up what might any way want of their external obſervation of the Law to juſtifie them. And it ſeems the Phariſaical Jews in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles days never pretended any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriouſneſs of faith in God or
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:40303:154"/> Chriſt, fear of God, love of God, repentance, Chriſtian obedience; therefore he never ſpeaketh directly of excluding theſe from merit, though, by conſequence, and by the parity of reaſon, they are excluded. It rather appeareth, that they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuch things as low unworthy things, in compariſon of thoſe things they moſt gloried in; and thought them needleſs as conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that they might be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied without them upon their exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal obſervances; or elſe he would more copiouſly, and <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> have told us, how theſe alſo are ſo far from meriting, that it would be damnable to account them me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, as he doth by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and would have yet told us more fully, they are conditions of the promiſe (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> doth afterward) and inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the word <hi>Faith</hi> which he uſeth. But this not being the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, he ſecurely comprehends all theſe things, obedience to the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:40303:154"/> Goſpel, the whole of Chriſtianity, in the word <hi>Faith,</hi> as being a word uſed ordinarily by Chriſtians to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the whole of Chriſtianity. By Faith, he meant Believing, and Living ſuch lives as thoſe Chriſtians at that time (that obſerved not the Ceremonial Law) lived. And we now by the word <hi>Believers,</hi> mean ſincere Chriſtians. When that great diſſention aroſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 5. ſome teaching, <hi>that except men were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and kept the Law of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>they could not be ſaved or juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;</hi> they meant, by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, thoſe Commands that required ſuch obſervances as were now really un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to juſtification and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being <hi>mortuae</hi> dead, though not yet <hi>mortiferae</hi> deadly: For had they only taught, That except men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and fear and love God, and obey him, they could not be ſaved; the Apoſtles would not have oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them in it. But they meant. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept men were circumciſed, and did thoſe things many of which none un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumiſed
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:40303:155"/> were to do (according to the Jews own opinion) they could not be juſtified and ſaved.</p>
            <p>Now their allegations to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their merits, being diverſe and various, and not punctually ſet down, becauſe well known to thoſe to whom he more particularly wrote: It need not offend us, that ſometime the Apoſtle hath refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to one of theſe pretences, ſometime to another; and that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are often obſcure; and that he ſometimes ſpeaks only of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law, ſometime only of the Moral, ſometimes of both; and ſometime it is not eaſily to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined which he ſpeaks of.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſuppoſe that true which ſome alledg (to prove that it is not much of the Apoſtle's buſineſs here to prove man's juſtification lies in pardon of ſin) <hi>viz.</hi> That it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable any ſhould think they needed no pardon (which yet is an opinion too frequent with men now, if there be any ſuch, as none que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:40303:155"/> but there are, that think they have ſo lived, that ſet one thing againſt another, it would be hard or unjuſt meaſure for God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them: for theſe judg freedom from the penalty to be due from natural Juſtice, and ſo not pardon) yet how ordinary is it for men that will pertinaciouſly defend an error, as theſe did (to wit, the excluding of the Gentiles without circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) to flye to ſome allegations that they can ſcarce believe themſelves?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider what was the Apoſtle's Deſign, what he aimed mainly to prove, in thoſe ſeemingly difficult paſſages about Juſtification, and you will find it was no way pertinent to it, to make an oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between what God hath join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> Belief of, and obedience to, the Goſpel. Now you will find his great Deſign, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving what occaſioned thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages from him, which was this.</p>

            <p>The Phariſaical Jews, all of them, yea ſome of them that were ſo far convinced of Chriſt's being the true Meſſiah, (by the undoubted atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidences) as to profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians <hi>(Acts 15. 5. Certain of the ſect of the Phariſes which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ſaid, that it was needful to circumciſe the Gentiles, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to keep the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes)</hi> were wicked oppoſers of <hi>Paul</hi>'s (the Miniſter of the Gentiles) preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, and receiving into the Church the Gentiles (1 Theſ. 2. 15. <hi>They pleaſe not God, and are contrary to all men, forbidding us to ſpeak to the Gentiles that they might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved);</hi> they could not endure that the ſinners of the Gentiles (as they were called probably ordinarily by them in oppoſition to Jews by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 15.) ſhould be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in as good a condition as they, when God had once purified their hearts by faith; and ſo no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in that reſpect.</p>
            <p>They are (think they) unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:40303:156"/> baſe, vile men; though Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they are uncircumciſed men (Eph. 2. 11. <hi>You are called uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion (i. e.</hi> by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt) <hi>by that which is called cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in the fleſh).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe Jews thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves brave, worthy, deſerving perſons (yea, though they lived wickedly) in that they were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s ſeed, and obſerved the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, in which they chiefly placed their merits; they gloried, <hi>We have Abraham to our Father,</hi> we are circumciſed; and thought upon that account they deſerved great reſpect from God and man: and ſhould the vile uncircumciſed Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles be in as good a condition as we, upon their receiving the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? What, are not Jews better than other men? And indeed, the Apoſtle himſelf, before his great change, thought theſe things high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving priviledges; and he names them as things he had much ado to obtain of himſelf to deny, formerly
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:40303:157"/> counting them great gain; much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do he had to quit confidence in things which he counted of, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him ſuch a full, rich, worthy Perſon, as to need no favour, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or forgiveneſs; though after, he counted them as nothing for theſe ends; yea, as loſs and hinderance, as he had uſed them, <hi>Phil 3. 23. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of dogs, and of Conciſion</hi> (that is, theſe Phariſaical Jews): <hi>for we are the circumciſion, which worſhip God in the ſpirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh</hi> (he called them <hi>conciſion,</hi> tearing dogs, rending, perſecuting, as the word ſignifieth; and they were: and ſaith, we are rather the <hi>circumciſion,</hi> i. e. truly honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble). V. 4. <hi>Though I might alſo have confidence in the fleſh: if any other man thinketh he hath that whereof he might truſt in the fleſh, I more; being circumciſed the eighth day, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, a Phariſee, touching the righteouſneſs which is of the law, blameleſs: but theſe things
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:40303:157"/> which were gain</hi> (of much deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving worth in my thoughts) <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as loſs, that I might be found in Chriſt, not having my own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is of the Law, but that which is of Chriſt by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be ſtrange, unwelcome, yea, abhorred doctrine, to teach the Religious Orders (as they call them) amongſt the Papiſts, That they are no better than others, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they live better. They would reply, Notwithſtanding our vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lives, yet we are of ſuch an Order, and have obſerved ſuch rules in diet, garments, and ſo have many good merits, are men of great deſerts. You may eaſily gueſs what the things were they placed merit in, if you conſider that few men uſe to place merit in the fear and love of God, or ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and univerſal endeavours to obey him, but in ſome external ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance, void of internal; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, chiefly in ſuch things as either are no duties, as Popiſh au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities;
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:40303:158"/> or in ſuch things as they account no duties, as giving alms; and ſo think they thereby ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogate, do ſo much not-required as will recompence their neglect of God and inward holineſs.</p>
            <p>They might, and it is probable did plead thus againſt the Gentiles being ſaved.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They are or were great ſinners, idolaters, <hi>ſinners of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and ſo there is no ſalvation for them by the Meſſiah. God would not be righteous, to admit ſuch into favour, to juſtifie ſuch; this would be to deal with men contrary to their deſerts, to juſtifie unrighteous men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, However there can be no hope for them except they become Jews firſt; and then their becoming Jews, and being circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and obſerving the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law (which they looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:40303:158"/> as things of great worth) may make ſuch an expiation and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for their Idolatries; will make them ſuch worthy perſons, as God may admit them into favour; as they thought that Ruler <hi>worthy</hi> to whom Chriſt ſhould do that kindneſs; for, ſay they, <hi>he hath built us a ſynagogue.</hi> But without thus doing, ſuch low things as their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and belief of, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to, the Goſpel, will ſtand them in no ſtead, they cannot be juſtified and ſaved.</p>
            <p>And they might have this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal motive, thus to oppoſe their admittance without circumciſion; We ſhall glory in their fleſh, in thus getting them circumciſed; for it will keep thoſe things ſtill in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; and we ſhall however be the chief, being natural, and the other but adventitious Jews.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle begins to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to theſe things, toward the end of the ſecond Chapter to the <hi>Romans.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ver. 17. Behold thou art called a Jew;</hi> a very honourable Name, but too worthy and honourable in your eſteem; <hi>and reſteſt in the law;</hi> chiefly in the Ceremonial; <hi>and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thy boaſt of God,</hi> as having God, in having <hi>Abraham</hi> to be your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; like that, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ver. 19. <hi>And art confident thou art a guide, an inſtructor of the fooliſh,</hi> eſpecially in ceremonial ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and traditions; but thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecteſt the weighty matters of the Law, thou liveſt looſly and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and yet counteſt it enough; thou art a Jew, and ſo a worthy deſerving man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 25. Circumciſion and ſuch things would profit, or however would have profited; if you did ſincerely obey the Moral Law, if you did walk in that inward holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ſuch things as Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion obliged you to. But if thou live wickedly, thou art no more a truly worthy perſon, than the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:40303:159"/> Gentiles that live wickedly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 26. And <hi>if the uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> the Gentiles, be converted and <hi>keep the righteouſneſs of the law,</hi> live holily, do that which circumciſion obliged you to, <hi>they ſhall be accounted the circumciſed</hi> men, the better men.</p>
            <p>Ver. 28. <hi>For he is not a Jew,</hi> a worthy man, <hi>who is</hi> only ſo in ſuch externals; <hi>neither is that</hi> the avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing to be <hi>circumciſed in the fleſh.</hi> V. 29. But he is rather the excellent man, and he is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God, who is circumciſed in heart. And though this be looked on as nothing by you, and ſuch as you, in compariſon of outward circumciſion, yet his <hi>praiſe is of God;</hi> God eſteems him, and approves him, though of grace. And this, as he had told us before in this Chapter <hi>(not the hearers but the doers of the Law ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, in the day when he ſhall judg all men according to the Goſpel)</hi> is the condition of juſtification and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:40303:160"/> and not the outward.</p>
            <p>Chap. 3. v. 1. <hi>What advantage then was there to the Jews? and what profit of circumciſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Much every way;</hi> it taught you and obliged you to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward holineſs; but <hi>chiefly, becauſe to them were committed the oracles of God;</hi> you had great helps that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wanted. For what though you lived wickedly? this doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but that theſe things did in their own nature ſtir up, teach, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige you to holineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. But what, were not we Jews better than the Gentiles, ſo as they to be ſinners, and we holy worthy men? No; we confeſs on all hands, the Gentiles were great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſo I will prove from the Scripture were the Jews alſo. <hi>None righteous, no not one; none that doth good: their throat is an open ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ver. 19. <hi>Now whatever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them under the Law;</hi> that is, whatever the Scripture
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:40303:160"/> ſpeaketh, it ſpeaketh of them that lived in Scripture-places; and this was written by <hi>David</hi> a Jew, and ſo he meant it of the wickedneſs of the Jews.</p>
            <p>So that all are ſinners, and under condemnation, you Jews as well as others, whatever your thoughts are to the contrary. And <hi>no fleſh can be juſtified in his ſight by the deeds of the law;</hi> no man ſhall be juſtified as being a man that deſerves it, or as having no need to have his ſin pardoned, ſo as his juſtification to be of debt, and not to be of grace, favour, and pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 25. But thus man's juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes about; God hath ſet forth Chriſt a Propitiation, ſince all are ſinners; and God juſtifieth men by this, for his ſake pardoning their ſins.</p>
            <p>Ver. 27. <hi>Where is boaſting then? it is excluded;</hi> but is not excluded by the Law of Works: for if a man was juſtified that way, he might boaſt, God pardoned him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:40303:161"/> but by this Law of Faith, by this Goſpel-way of pardoning ſinners without merits or ſtrict Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs. And therefore the Gentiles may be ſaved if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians, and have this heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion (though they have not theſe outward priviledges which you account things of ſuch great worth) God pardoning their ſins upon their believing the Goſpel, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their hearts purified by it, which you account ſuch low ignoble things.</p>

This Chapter is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the oppoſers of the doctrine I taught, to have the greateſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance againſt it; but I ſhall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, it doth not in the leaſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it. The deſign of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as you will ſee, is to prove the whole buſineſs, That the Gentiles may be juſtified and ſaved by grace and pardon of ſin, upon their turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from idolatries, and believing and obeying the Goſpel, without Circumciſion; and he proveth it by
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:40303:161"/> this argument, <hi>viz. Abraham</hi> was a ſinner, and was not juſtified for any original righteouſneſs, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never ſinned; nor for any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious works or priviledges of his that in Juſtice deſerved the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by making ſatisfaction for his ſins (for that would ſtill be of debt from natural Law and Equity; if a man could do ſomething after great Crimes that ſatisfies for them all, it would be ſo of Juſtice to acquit him, as not to be of Grace; it would however be, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle expreſſeth it, <gap reason="foreign">

But when it is ſaid,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:40303:162"/> 
               <hi>Abraham was juſtified;</hi> the meaning is, he was pardoned; and if ſo, God may juſtifie the Gentiles on that manner, <hi>viz.</hi> by pardoning them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver. 1. Shall we ſay that Abraham found (i. e.</hi> all that kindneſs, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and juſtification) <hi>from the fleſh, i. e.</hi> from works, as we ſee in the following verſe? for <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:40303:163"/> 
               <hi>[acceptilatio]</hi> is uſed in ſuch caſes as when a man accepts from his deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor a penny for a hundred pound, and acquits him upon it. So this very word implieth that his belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving was ſo low a thing, as not to be any way meritorious of thoſe great things God rewarded him with upon it. He lays all the ſtreſs (as you will ſee by the following verſes) upon this word <hi>[counted]</hi> that it ſignifieth <hi>graciouſly acquitted him,</hi> and not as a juſt man that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it.</p>

This very word implies, that God might juſtly have refuſed to have juſtified him upon his believing. This is the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:40303:163" rendition="simple:additions"/> with that, Rom. 11. 6. <hi>If it be of grace, then it is not of works, i. e.</hi> of meritorious works; <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe grace is not grace</hi> and mercy: <hi>but if it be of works,</hi> i. e. merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works, <hi>then it is no more of grace</hi> and mercy, <hi>elſe works is not works;</hi> that is, merit is not merit, merit doth not deſerve; which is a contradiction.</p>
            <p>Ver. 5.—<hi>Counted it to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> It cannot be ſaid that a man's believing, or repenting, or any other duty, is counted, that is, graciouſly counted for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, except the man be, and theſe things be void of merit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it implies, That <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved one that juſtified an ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, an undeſerving man, a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a man unjuſt: juſtified a man in the ſtrict ſenſe of the law unjuſt, by pardoning his ſins, his unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Yea, it is probable, that by the word <hi>[ungodly]</hi> in this verſe, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was once an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolater as the Gentiles are. This
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:40303:164"/> plainly proves, his juſtification was by pardon of ſin; and that he was a man God might juſtly have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have thus juſtified; and that he was not righteous in God's ſight, in the primary, ſtrict, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſe of the word, but meerly of grace and pardon.</p>
            <p>Ver. 6.

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:40303:164"/> but pardon of ſin: and ſo the meaning is, God pardoned <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s ſin upon his <hi>believing God.</hi> Which ſheweth, he was no ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man as you think your ſelves, ſo as to need no forgiveneſs.</p>

You will find this was ſaid concerning <hi>Abraham</hi> before he was circumciſed, <hi>when he was as yet uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,</hi> when he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to this high meritorious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg

Why may not they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be juſtified in ſuch a Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as he was, having their ſin par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned through the Propitiation, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their only believing and obeying the Goſpel? For though you look upon Faith and Obedience as low things in compariſon of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; yet theſe were graciouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted from him by God, and his ſins pardoned thereon; and why may they not be accepted from them, without meritorious works, if it be granted ſuch are ſo, which you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſo?</p>
            <p>Ver. 11. <hi>And he received the ſign of circumciſion, the ſeal of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the faith which he had being uncircumciſed, that he might be the father of all them that believe,</hi> though they be not circumciſed, that righteouſneſs might be imputed unto them alſo.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>The ſign of circumciſion,</hi> or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Circumciſion; it is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner of ſpeaking, the <hi>geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivus ſpecie;</hi> as we uſe to ſay, the <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſm,</hi> for <hi>the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Baptiſm;</hi> ſo, <hi>the ſign of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> for <hi>the ſign Circumciſion;</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith he found it ſo, in the Accuſative caſe, in an ancient Copy.</p>
            <p>By receiving the ſign of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, is not only or chiefly meant
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:40303:166"/> his receiving it in his body, though he did ſo; but his receiving it in the inſtitution or law of it from God, as <hi>John</hi> may be ſaid to have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved baptiſm, being the firſt to whom it was delivered by God, as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, to be by him as a Miniſter adminiſtred.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid <hi>(Acts</hi> 7. 28.) to <hi>receive the lively oracles of God</hi> to give to the Jews; and <hi>John. 7. 22. Moſes gave unto you circumciſion,</hi> i. e. the Ordinance of it. Without doubt he is ſaid here to receive circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſenſe that God is ſaid <hi>(Acts</hi> 7. 8.) to <hi>give him the covenant of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> not in the ſenſe wherein he gave it to himſelf, circumciſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I grant it doth connote ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily his receiving it in his body, yet ſtill as in the law and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of it, ſo as to begin it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And that which makes it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear to be ſo meant, is this, becauſe the ſtreſs of his becoming <hi>the father of all that believe,</hi> &amp;c. ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be laid here: For if it ſhould
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:40303:166"/> have the other ſenſe, all circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed might on the ſame account be called Fathers of them that believe. And elſe it is probable the Apoſtle would have uſed the ordinary word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and have ſaid, <hi>he was circumciſed;</hi> and not, <hi>he received circumciſion. Abraham</hi> was honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God to be the firſt receiver of this Inſtitution. Indeed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or covenant that this ſealed, had been made known to the world long before, <hi>viz.</hi> That whoſoever of faln man ſhould repent and believe God, and obey him ſincerely, ſhould be ſaved: and all that were juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before <hi>Abraham,</hi> were juſtified by this law of grace made in the blood of Chriſt: but <hi>Abraham</hi> was the firſt that received from God this viſible ſeal to confirm it to the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſeal of the rightsouſneſs of the faith, which he had being uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</hi> Theſe words ſeem an exege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Parentheſis, or a Parenthetical explication of the former words, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:40303:167"/> the ſign of circumciſion.</hi> For theſe words, <hi>that he might be the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſeem to have their dependance on, and reſpect to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the former words, <hi>received the ſign of circumciſion.</hi> In theſe words here is a definition of that, and alſo of every other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Inſtitution. Circumciſion is called a <hi>ſign</hi> or token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. and it is called fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively the <hi>Covenant,</hi> v. 10. and <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 8. even as the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is alſo called the <hi>Covenant; This is the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in my blood;</hi> that is, the ſign or ſeal of the Covenant founded in my blood.</p>
            <p>By the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> is not here to be underſtood that perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal individual faith which he had; but a faith of that ſort or kind, which he had, even in ſuch a ſenſe as that faith which dwelt firſt in his Grandmother <hi>Lois,</hi> and Mother <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> is ſaid to dwell in <hi>Timothy,</hi> to wit, not the ſame individual act or habit, but a faith of the ſame ſort
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:40303:167"/> or ſpecies, <hi>i. e. faith unfeigned,</hi> as he explains it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. and ſo theſe words, <hi>the faith of Abraham,</hi> (ver. 16. of this Chapter) muſt neceſſarily be underſtood to this ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Again, Circumciſion is not ſaid by the Apoſtle to be a ſign or ſeal of his faith, or any one's elſe; no, that is a miſtake; though I know in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſenſe Circumciſion was, and Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper are, a ſeal or ſeals of mens faith or reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, <hi>viz.</hi> as they are mens ſeals. We receiving them, engage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs we do reſtipulate and oblige our ſelves to perform faith, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſeal it by receiving the elements: We ſo ſeal, as hereby to oblige our ſelves, and to be guilty of falſhood in the Covenant if we do not perform. Yea, he that is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized while an Infant, is a debtor to the Goſpel, as well as he that was circumciſed when an Infant, was a debtor to the Law. But this is not meant here; for this definition ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:40303:168"/> only of Circumciſion as God's ſeal, and God doth not ſeal that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man believeth reſtipulateth; he ſealeth only what he ſaith and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, to wit, his own part of the Covenant. He no where teſtifieth, that this or that man believeth; but that if he do, he ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. I ſay, it is not ſaid to be a ſeal of his <hi>faith,</hi> but of the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of his faith, of that faith which he had being uncircumciſed,</hi> of ſuch a kind of faith. That is, it is a ſign or ſeal of juſtification upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of believing as he did while uncircumciſed. It is a ſeal of the truth of this Covenant or Promiſe, and of God's faithfulneſs in ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. He that believeth with ſuch a kind of working-faith, ſhall be juſtified and ſaved; or, to ſpeak more properly, he that believeth and obeyeth as <hi>Abraham</hi> did.</p>
            <p>It was indeed a ſeal of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith (ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively and individually taken) but not as his faith; elſe it would ſeal
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:40303:168"/> righteouſneſs and juſtification to none elſe, upon ſuch a faith as his. Though it did ſeal his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he having that ſort of faith the general promiſe was made to; yet it did not ſeal his juſtification primarily, but only conſequentially, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſealing the general promiſe. It did not ſeal juſtification to his faith as his; but as true, unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or faith of ſuch a ſort, ſuch an operative, obediential one, as the Promiſe was made to, which was ſealed. It would have ſealed that thing it did ſeal (that promiſe, he <hi>that ſo believeth ſhall be ſaved;</hi> he that believeth with ſuch a kind of faith as is deſcribed by being called the faith which <hi>Abraham</hi> had being uncircumciſed) whether <hi>Abraham</hi> had believed or no: for, that he believed, was, as we uſe to ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent or accidental to the thing ſealed. I know ſome <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> to elude arguments drawn from hence, would have it a ſeal of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith only,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:40303:169"/> and that it was ſo to none elſe; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting it to this ſenſe, to wit, That it was given as a reward to him, a great and ſignal believer, and others were circumciſed upon other accounts. But if this was the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we might as well call every great bleſſing (which he had as a reward of his faith, as having chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in his old age, deliverance from dangers and difficulties, and conquering enemies, which were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him as rewards of his faith, and tokens of God's love) a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of his faith, and a ſign or token of the Covenant, as this is called, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. and as the <hi>Rain-bow</hi> is called a ſign or token of another Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 8.</p>
            <p>Now if Circumciſion was not a ſeal of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith at all, nor a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s faith as his (as hath been, and might further be made apparent) but of the righteouſneſs of ſuch a kind of faith as his was; then it evidently
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:40303:169"/> and eſſentially follows, that it was a ſeal or confirming-ſign of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, covenant, or promiſe, made to the whole world, That whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of faln man ſhould believe God as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, ſhould be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, treated by God as righteous; be juſtified, pardoned, rewarded, bleſſed, (theſe words are promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly uſed) whether he be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or not; and ſo the Apoſtle ſaith in the latter part of the verſe, <hi>that righteouſneſs might be imputed to them alſo that believe,</hi> though not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. For that he be circumciſed, is ſo alien from the promiſe, as to be no part of the condition: for elſe Circumciſion had ſealed an untruth, if a man that ſhould perform the condition, ſhould not be juſtified though he be uncircumciſed.</p>
            <p>And indeed, ſince Baptiſm is a ſeal of the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> of juſtification or remiſſion of ſins upon repentance, and bringeth forth fruits meet and ſuitable, as is ſaid of <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm (and ſure you will grant the faith
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:40303:170"/> required in thoſe days was included in the word <hi>Repentance):</hi> And the Lord's Supper is a ſeal of the ſame New Covenant made in Chriſt's blood, called alſo the Goſpel which the Apoſtles were ſent to preach. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He hath made us able Miniſters of the New Covenant,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6. and we ſee what that Covenant is, <hi>Rom. 10. 6, 8. The word of faith which we</hi> (that is, he and other Apoſtles) <hi>preach:</hi> the law of faith is this, <hi>If thou believe, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Since, I ſay, this is the tenour of that which Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper ſeal, <hi>if men believe and obey the Goſpel, they ſhall be ſaved;</hi> it doth demonſtrably alſo follow, that if a man did perform the Goſpel-condition, the condition of that Covenant whereof Baptiſm is a ſeal, he would be juſtified and ſaved whether he were baptized or no, whether he received the Lords Supper or not (as our Divines uſe to prove againſt the Papiſts), elſe they did ſeal an untruth. And ſurely
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:40303:170"/> none will deny, but thoſe holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients we read of in the primitive time of Chriſtianity, who terrified through an Error taught by ſome, <hi>(viz.</hi> That there was no remiſſion for ſins committed after it) deferred Baptiſm till toward their death, were juſtified before Baptiſm; and they that ſo delayed, as to dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, were yet ſaved by virtue of the Goſpel promiſe which it ſeals. If it it ſeal this, <hi>He that believeth in the Goſpel ſenſe,</hi> that is, believeth and obeyeth the Goſpel, <hi>ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi> then it evidently follows, that the receiving the ſeal is no part of the condition, nor neceſſary with this kind of neceſſity as the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Though I could ſhew you how it may indirectly, and <hi>quaſi poſtli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minio jure,</hi> come to be neceſſary to the condition; and alſo how it is directly neceſſary upon other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; not only <hi>neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> but by way of accommodation, to work, preſerve, and encreaſe the condition, and to comfort and aſſure.</p>
            <pb n="340" facs="tcp:40303:171"/>
            <p>And the Objection here ariſing is inconſiderable, <hi>viz.</hi> That one that ſhould refuſe to be baptized (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never been baptized before) and to receive the Lords Supper, cannot have the condition. For though in ordinary circumſtances in our days, wherein there is much light, and ſuch things are made plain; it would be next to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility that a man ſhould heartily believe all Fundamentals; and be heartily willing, and earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous, to obey God and Chriſt in every command, to the beſt of his knowledg, and yet through ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>or refuſe the Sacrament; yet ſuch a thing it may be is poſſible: for you will not be ſo uncharitable as to deny this of thoſe Ancients, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hiſtory tells us of. But however, let it be granted that this cannot be (as it is indeed certain it cannot be in ordinary caſes; for it would be ordinarily a wilful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refuſal to ſubmit to Chriſt's rule and dominion, which indeed is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:40303:171"/> inconſiſtent with performing the Goſpel-condition) yet this doth not oppoſe this <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> for it ſpeaketh only on ſuppoſition, If a man were a truly believing and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely obedient one, who ſhould thus refuſe to comply with theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial commands, he would be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and ſaved. And by the way you may obſerve, that which may be very helpful to you for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding theſe and many other things, <hi>viz.</hi> this, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that which is neceſſary as a condition of a promiſe, and that which is not a condition, but is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary upon ſome other account; you may ſay of any performance that is not a condition of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, That if he perform it not, he will yet have right, ſo he do but perform the condition, though he cannot perform the condition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out performing this thing. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, if any ſhould deny ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience to be a condition of juſtification, he muſt ſay (or he ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:40303:172"/> contradicts himſelf), That if a man ſhould believe, though he did reſolve, never to obey, he muſt be juſtified and ſaved, though it ſhould be granted he cannot believe without obeying.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle here hath proved, That Circumciſion is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meritorious, as the Jews held, that it was not ſo much as a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſary to juſtification. And though it might be objected here by the Jews, But why are not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving-Gentiles then circumciſed upon thoſe other accounts? Yet here is enough ſaid for the preſent ſcope in proving juſtification may be had without it; and this is anſwered by the Apoſtle in other places: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they might eaſily anſwer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, knowing there was another ſeal inſtituted inſtead of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, called <hi>the circumciſion of Chriſt, Col.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that I have let my Pen run out of my deſigned ſhort method, thinking theſe words need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:40303:172"/> to be underſtood, to rectifie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vulgar miſtakes, and to give light to theſe and other contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.</p>
            <p>If any diſlike what is here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or do not underſtand me, or think I contradict my ſelf; they may paſs this over, as being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alien, and only read this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which is enough to my main deſign.</p>
            <p>What pretence have any from this place to maintain, That repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or obedience are not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to juſtification or right to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or that they are not included in the word Faith? May we not ſay of Circumciſion, that it was, as Baptiſm is, a ſeal of remiſſion of ſins upon repentance and faith? was it not a ſeal of this promiſe, He that repenteth, believeth, and obeyeth, walketh in the ſteps that <hi>Abraham</hi> walked in, ſhall be ſaved? Yet that you miſtake not ſome words I have here uſed, take notice, That when I uſe theſe words, <hi>ſuch a kind of faith
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:40303:173"/> as</hi> Abraham'<hi>s, an operative faith;</hi> I grant I ſpeak vulgarly, cuſtomari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and improperly; and not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ſtrictly uſing the word <hi>[Faith]</hi> for that which is properly ſo called: for I know, that it is not of the eſſence of faith to be opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or not operative; the effect is no part of the cauſe; nor doth <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredi definitionem;</hi> it is not the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>generis in ſpecies ſuas,</hi> but <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti per adjuncta,</hi> or <hi>cauſae per effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus.</hi> So when we ſpeak of operative knowledg, we mean by it ſomething more than knowledg, yea ſomething that is not knowledg, but that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg produceth. For all that is ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly knowledg, that is underſtood in this phraſe, <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive knowledg,</hi> may be in a wicked man. If you ſhall object, <hi>But not ſo clear a knowledg or faith;</hi> Let that be as it will, true or falſe, the degree doth not alter the ſpecies. So that if I would have ſpoken ſtrictly and properly, I ſhould have ſaid, <hi>He that believeth and obeyeth with that kind
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:40303:173"/> of faith and obedience that</hi> Abraham <hi>did, ſhall be juſtified.</hi> This I could make plain; but it is not my buſineſs here to prove, but my deſign is only to anſwer, thinking I have proved ſufficiently already. But to proceed with the words.</p>

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:40303:174"/> meaning; or, if it be, alſo conno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the phraſe (as it is likely it is) it ſeemeth not to be inſiſted on here by the Apoſtle, as his chief meaning of his being a father; but this only or chiefly, his being a prime firſt pattern of the juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both of the Gentile and Jewiſh believers. I think, I could ſhew you great inconſiſtencies and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies in any other explication of this verſe, ſetting the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie aſide. And becauſe I uſe to think I cannot ſpeak very intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in ſuch things without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I will here give you one: Suppoſe a great King ſhould give to an offender that hath pleaſed him by ſome exploits, a Livery to be worn by him and his Family, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to ſeal and oblige himſelf to, and aſſure others of, this promiſe, That whatſoever offender or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhall do as he did (before his receiving of it) he or they ſhall be acquitted from all penalties. Here, 1. The firſt receiving this Livery to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:40303:175"/> be worn by him and his, is given as a reward to him (and not by way of ſealing) and as a peculiar token of the Royal favour; and the ſame may be ſaid of his exploits being mentioned in the promiſe to deſcribe the condition by: For it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and caſt an honour on him, to make them a pattern to others. Theſe two agree to none elſe; and therefore herein muſt the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood lye. 2.

            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. And ſecondly, A father or pattern of the manner of the juſtification of us Jews, that have theſe outward priviledges, in that we muſt be juſtified as he was. He was indeed circumciſed as we are; but his juſtification was not by that, or any merit of that; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his juſtification was his heart-circumciſion, his believing, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying, fearing God; and ſo muſt be, and always was the juſtification of any Jew, not by, or by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

            </p>
            <p>Ver. 13. <hi>For the promiſe that he ſhould be heir of the world,</hi> that is, have great things, have great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and ſpiritual mercies, <hi>Canaan</hi> and Heaven, the world to come ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified by it, was not made to him and his ſeed, that is, ſuch as he, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient believers (as you may ſee by the places after cited) through the law, Obey perfectly, and live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pardon, and ſo not of Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; but through the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith, by a promiſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs in a gracious Evangelical way, upon their repenting, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, obeying God. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6. what is meant by <hi>the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> to wit, a law of grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gal. 3. v.</hi> 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. is a place parallel to this, where the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:40303:177"/> Covenant confirmed of God in Chriſt to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, that is, of an inheritance and bleſſedneſs to men walking in the ſteps of his faith, is called the promiſe whereby he gave the inheritance to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and by his ſeed there, are meant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as you may ſee plainly by <hi>v.</hi> 29. and by Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 16. is meant Chriſt myſtical, <hi>viz.</hi> Believers, as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors agree.</p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>Heb. 9. 15. A Mediator of the new teſtament,</hi> or covenant, <hi>that they which are called (i. e.</hi> effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, obedient believers) <hi>might receive the promiſe of the eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ver. 14. <hi>For if</hi> only <hi>they that are of the law</hi> (that is, they that are righteous without pardon, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obey, ſee <hi>Gal. 3. 10.) be heirs,</hi> are to have great things, <hi>then faith is made void, and the promiſe made of none effect;</hi> that is, then there is no place, no reward for faith, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and turning from ſin to God, for thoſe that have been ſinners, or
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:40303:177"/> obey not the Law perfectly, and that implied promiſe, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in God's juſtifying <hi>Abraham</hi> upon believing, God not being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; but <hi>whoſoever feareth God, and worketh righteouſneſs, ſhall be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi> and that promiſe which was ſealed in circumciſion, <hi>That whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould believe and obey God as he did, ſhall find great reward as he did,</hi> is made of none effect, if men be to attain the reward by the Law of works without pardon. And the Law given Four hundred thirty years after (if it require perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo as to accept nothing leſs) hath diſannulled this promiſe. Then none can be juſtified unleſs they be men of ſuch merits as you ſuppoſe ſuch outward obſervances and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges make you; that it is due of ſtrict Juſtice, and not from a gracious promiſe made to ſinners. And alſo I will ſhew, that you that are of the Law, and ſtick to that, cannot be juſtified or ſaved, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you think to the contrary.</p>
            <pb n="354" facs="tcp:40303:178"/>
            <p>Ver. 15. <hi>For the law worketh wrath: for where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth what he affirmeth before, That happineſs comes not by the Moral Law, and ſo neither by any ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate revelation which is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively comprehended in it; not by the whole ſyſtem or body of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, by the command of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, which reductively belongs to the Moral Law, for that is, <hi>Obey whatever I ſhall any way command you, or dye;</hi> and none perfectly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. That place <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. is like this; <hi>As many as are of the works of the law</hi> (i. e. ſtick to that for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication) <hi>are under a curſe: for it is written, Curſed is every one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not in all things written in the law to do them:</hi> Which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Apoſtle's would be inconſequent, but that it leans upon this implied foundation that none do ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> all things written.</p>
            <pb n="355" facs="tcp:40303:178"/>
            <p>So here the meaning is this: theſe laws, take them as laws and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they only work wrath, and make ſins more, by multiplying commands more, and ſo make the Jews more guilty than any, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from juſtification than any, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more laws, and more clearly revealed. A man that would look to be juſtified by exact obedience to every precept, and will look for no pardon, will find theſe laws will be ſo far from juſtifying him, and conferring right to any reward that they work only wrath, and oblige him the more to condemnation. For, <hi>where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> Many of theſe things which you Jews ſinned in omitting, would have been no ſins, had not God thus revealed his will to you in ſuch multitudes of commands; and others not ſo great ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. Therefore happineſs is not by the law, that is, by unſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning obedience, or making all up by
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:40303:179"/> meritorious works; but <hi>by faith,</hi> that is, in a Goſpel-way, by ſome promiſe made of pardon to ſinners, called <hi>the law of faith;</hi> by ſome promiſe made to ſinners (to whom juſtification cannot be of debt); up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their repentance, belief, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere endeavour of obedience. And it is thus of faith, that it might be of grace and mercy. And it is thus of faith, that the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed, that is, to all that walk in the ſteps of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith, that believe, repent, obey God in difficulties, whether they have thoſe great priviledges you boaſt of, as the Jews; or none ſuch, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. And ſo he is the father of us all both Jews and Gentiles, <hi>i. e.</hi> a pattern of our juſtification; both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified the ſame way as he was.</p>
            <p>Ver. 17. <hi>As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations.</hi> Either this is a remote meaning of theſe words cited; or it is an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive accommodative making uſe of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:40303:179"/> this citation, which ſeemeth frequent with this Apoſtle. The meaning however of the Apoſtle is this: As I have received thee into favour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy believing me in every thing, and obeying and following my call; ſo, many of ſeveral Nations, both Jews and Gentils, ſhall receive grace and favour, and bleſſedneſs from me, in thus turning from ſin, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and obeying me, as thou haſt, and ſo be juſtified in ſuch a way as thou art; and ſo thou ſhalt be their Father, a prime example or pattern of their juſtification.</p>

               <hi>Ver.</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21. He ſheweth the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> was a great and ſtrong faith; he believed the moſt unlikely things upon God's credit; <hi>believed againſt hope;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved God was able to do what he promiſed, though never ſo unlikely; he never conſidered the difficulty: it was a faith that carried him out to truſt and obey God in every thing.

            <p>Ver. 22. <hi>And therefore it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> That is, as I have again and again explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, he was graciouſly accepted and acquitted, and rewarded upon it, and treated as if he had been an innocent juſt perſon, though he was not ſo in the ſtrict ſenſe of the law, or natural equity.</p>

            <p>Ver. 3. <hi>For they being ignorant of God's righteouſneſs</hi> (i. e. his way of juſtifying ſinners by pardon) <hi>and going about to eſtabliſh their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> (of perfect obedience or meritorious works) <hi>have not ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves to the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> that is, God's way of pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners by the Goſpel, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it, <hi>v.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Ver. 4. <hi>For Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi> It is to be acknowledged that the Law, as every Law, doth require as its end perfect obedience primarily; and upon default of that, ſecondarily the puniſhment of the tranſgreſſors. But Chriſt hath ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied this, as much to God's honour and its content, as if it had been perfectly obeyed, or the penalty ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by us. And this Propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is for thoſe that believe, that perform the Goſpel condition. So that there is no neceſſity now of our unſinning obedience, or our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:40303:181"/> ſatisfaction by meritorious works in order to our juſtification; but only of our performing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-condition: and they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this way of God.</p>
            <p>Ver. 5. <hi>For Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſneſs of the law,</hi> the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, the way that they ſtick to for juſtification, thus: <hi>That the man that doth theſe things, ſhall live by them;</hi> i. e. without pardon, <hi>Lev. 18. 5. Gal. 3. 12. Moſes deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> that is, theſe words of <hi>Moſes</hi> taken in the ſtrict law-ſenſe, as a law, and in the ſenſe you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, repreſent that way you ſtick to for juſtification; I ſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent that way.</p>
            <p>For it is apparent that thoſe very words, and the whole body of the Moſaical law, were a Goſpel-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace as they were given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and underſtood, and ought to be underſtood by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: The meaning was, If you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do all theſe ſincerely,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:40303:182"/> and lament your falling ſhort, you ſhall be juſtified, bleſſed, live; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe you ſhall periſh. I could make this fully apparent, that it was a gracious Covenant: for it was ſpoken to ſinners, and with ſuch words, <hi>I am the Lord thy God;</hi> and, <hi>If you will obey my voice;</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſprinkleth blood, and ſaith, <hi>Behold the blood of the Covenant;</hi> which Covenant they reſtipulated to, when they promiſed to obey his voice; and God ſaith, <hi>I have heard the words of this people, and they have well ſaid in all that they have ſaid:</hi> which he would not have ſaid, if the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had been, We promiſe to do things impoſſible; to make that it ſhould be ſaid, We never have been ſinners, and we will perfectly obey in every thing, without the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſs in thought, word, or deed. But to be ſhort, ſee Mr. <hi>Ant.

            <p>Theſe Jews were for juſtification by it meerly as a Law, and ſtrict Covenant of Works, as if there was no juſtification to be expected from it, but by reaching the preceptive part in every thing; and if ſo, then there was an end of the Goſpel preached to <hi>Abraham;</hi> then this Law that was 430 years after it, would have diſannulled the promiſe made of God in Chriſt, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould believe, repent, obey ſincerely, ſhould be ſaved.

            <p>But take it as a law, a ſtrict law of works, and it is repreſented by that, <hi>The man that doth theſe things, ſhall live by them;</hi> which is indeed eſſential to every law; any law ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth the doers of it; and in this ſenſe there can be no juſtification, that is, juſtification without pardon, but by doing every thing: if you be guilty of the leaſt omiſſion or negligence, you are out of its ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and under its condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or curſe.</p>

            <p>For the Goſpel-rule of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the righteouſneſs of faith in that Chapter mentioned, ſaith, <hi>Say not in thy heart, Who ſhall aſcend? &amp;c.</hi> that is, Be not now ſollicitous, do not perplex your ſelves in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Alas I am hopeleſs, for I have broken the law; or, I ſhall never be able exactly to obey it for the future in every thing: Do not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelves as if God required any thing of you that you could not perform, though you was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſirous to do it with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing-bent of your ſoul: for as for thoſe failings which are conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with this, though they be ſins, yet they ſhould not cauſe deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trouble: For Chriſt by his ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

But all that is required of you for life and juſtification, is a thing very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, was there but a willing mind. God will not require what you have not (as ſome troubled ſouls are apt to think) what is ſo out of your power, that you cannot do it, though you fain would; but will, if there be a willing mind, accept of what you have, ſuch poor ſtuff as our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſtate is capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, if willing. It is now brought to your own choice <hi>(I have ſet life and death before you, therefore chuſe life,</hi> v. 19.) you cannot now chuſe it on the terms of it, and yet miſs it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Say not in thy heart, Who ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into heaven?</hi> as if the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of juſtification to thee a ſinner, was ſuch a thing as could not be come by, was ſet before thee on an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible condition: this is in effect to deny Chriſt is riſen and aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>
               <hi>Say not, Who ſhall deſcend into the deep?</hi> do ſome impoſſible thing to fetch up righteouſneſs and life for us ſinners.

To believe God hath teſtified him to be the Meſſiah, by raiſing him from the dead, notwithſtanding all ſcoffs at the reſurrection, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to perſwade you to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and confeſſing him in the times of danger and difficulty, when like to loſe all by it: and many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatizing Chriſtians maintained it was not neceſſary to confeſs, but that they might deny him when danger approached, ſo they but kept their hearts right; which ſeemeth to be implyed in thoſe
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:40303:185"/> ironical expreſſions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Ver. 10. <hi>For with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. True hearty yeelding to the obedience of the Goſpel, is enough at firſt for juſtification: but if you would have your juſtification ſo to continue, as to reach ſalvation, you muſt hold out to the end, in confeſſing him, though with the danger of your lives.</p>
            <p>Ver. 11. <hi>For the Scripture ſaith, Whoſoever believeth on him, ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>For there is no difference between the Jew and Gentile: For the ſame Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him.</hi> Ver. 13. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall call on the Name of the Lord, ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> It is all one as if he had ſaid, Whoſoever believeth, and carrieth ſuitably to ſuch belief, ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and he uſeth <hi>calling on God,</hi> and <hi>believing God,</hi> promiſcuouſly; which would not be ſenſe, if they did not mean the ſame thing, the ſame Goſpel-condition. And indeed,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:40303:186"/> as many promiſes of Juſtification and Pardon are made to Prayer, as to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; but the meaning is, carry ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to ſuch prayer, believe, obey, repent.</p>
            <p>I am weary of eaſie work, and ſo give over. All thoſe other places in this Apoſtle's Epiſtles, that have any ſhew to oppoſe the Doctrine delivered, are to be interpreted in purſuance of this deſign, That men are juſtified only by pardon of ſin, through the Propitiation, upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming thoſe conditions pardon is promiſed to; and ſo may the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles be juſtified without ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to the Law, or meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious priviledges, or ſatisfactions. If I ſhould proceed, I can only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the ſame again and again, with very little variation, upon the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces following, <hi>Gal. 2. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Gal.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gal. 5. 2. Paul</hi> once circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> yet here ſaith, <hi>Behold I Paul ſay unto you, If you be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,</hi> that is, upon this account
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:40303:186"/> (elſe he would not have ſpoken ſo ſeverely) to make you ſuch worthy perſons as to need no pardon; <hi>Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ver. 3. <hi>For I teſtifie again to every man that ſhall now be</hi> (thus, or on this account) <hi>circumciſed, he is a deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the whole Law.</hi> He muſt look to it that he fail not in the leaſt; for he virtually diſclaims all pardon by Chriſt, and ſo ſhall not have it.</p>
            <p>So, <hi>Tit. 3. 5. Not by works of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which we have done, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>That being juſtified by his grace,</hi> &amp;c. This Scripture tells us what is meant by <hi>work,</hi> and what by <hi>faith;</hi> and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to any conſidering man, <hi>James</hi> 2. 14, to the end.</p>
            <p>When ſome had (it is probable) miſ-underſtood ſuch expreſſions in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, as if only belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the truth was enough for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſhews, that by <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith, was meant
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:40303:187"/> his faith and obedience; and ſaith that thoſe words, <hi>believed God,</hi> mean <hi>believed God and obeyed him,</hi> in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up his ſon; and other diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties like that, 1 Maccab. 2. 52. <hi>Was not Abraham found faithful in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs?</hi> As <hi>Phineas executed judgment, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs throughout all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;</hi> that is, God rewarded him graciouſly with an everlaſting Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, as if he had been a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, a deſerving man; when yet he was not, by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s argument, that the word <hi>[counted]</hi> implieth it was not due to him ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but of grace: Ver. 22, 23. <hi>When he offered up his ſon, then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was fulfilled,</hi> perfectly explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>that ſaith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</hi> that is, God acquitted and rewarded him upon his faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as if he had been a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, when indeed he was not.</p>
            <pb n="373" facs="tcp:40303:187"/>
            <p>And you may obſerve it would as much ſerve the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, and ſupport what he builds upon it, if the very words had run thus, <hi>Abraham believed and obeyed, and it was counted,</hi> &amp;c. and it is plain that was the meaning, as you may ſee, <hi>Gen. 22. 8. In thy ſeed ſhall all nations be bleſſed, becauſe thou haſt obeyed my voice:</hi> or if they had run thus, <hi>He walked before God, and was upright, and it was counted,</hi> &amp;c. and this is ſaid in effect, in ſaying, If he did ſo, God would do great things for him, <hi>cap.</hi> 17. 2. Or if the words had been expreſly thus; <hi>Abraham feared God, and it was accounted to him for righteouſneſs:</hi> and we do read as much in ſenſe, though not in expreſs words, Gen. 22. 12. <hi>For now I know thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not with-held,</hi> &amp;c. Ver. 16. <hi>By my ſelf have I ſworn, For becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and haſt not with held thy ſon, that in bleſſing I will bleſs thee.</hi> It would be a poor bleſſing, if it did not include juſtification. I ſay,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:40303:188"/> had the words run ſo, the Apoſtle is ſo far from excluding theſe things from being a condition of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſuch words would as well have proved what he is proving; only they would not ſo occaſionally have ſerved to preſs them to the great difficult duty of that day, the believing Chriſt's Reſurrection.</p>
